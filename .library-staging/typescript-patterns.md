In this chapter, we'll cover some of the most common types of values you'll find in JavaScript code, and explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in TypeScript.
This isn't an exhaustive list, and future chapters will describe more ways to name and use other types.

Types can also appear in many more _places_ than just type annotations.
As we learn about the types themselves, we'll also learn about the places where we can refer to these types to form new constructs.

We'll start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code.
These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

## The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

JavaScript has three very commonly used [primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive): `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript.
As you might expect, these are the same names you'd see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a value of those types:

- `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`
- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply `number`
- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`

> The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. _Always_ use `string`, `number`, or `boolean` for types.

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on).
You may also see this written as `Array<number>`, which means the same thing.
We'll learn more about the syntax `T<U>` when we cover _generics_.

> Note that `[number]` is a different thing; refer to the section on [Tuples](/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types).

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that's syntactically legal:

```ts twoslash
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

The `any` type is useful when you don't want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

### `noImplicitAny`

When you don't specify a type, and TypeScript can't infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn't type-checked.
Use the compiler flag [`noImplicitAny`](/tsconfig#noImplicitAny) to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

## Type Annotations on Variables

When you declare a variable using `const`, `var`, or `let`, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable:

```ts twoslash
let myName: string = "Alice";
//        ^^^^^^^^ Type annotation
```

> TypeScript doesn't use "types on the left"-style declarations like `int x = 0;`
> Type annotations will always go _after_ the thing being typed.

In most cases, though, this isn't needed.
Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically _infer_ the types in your code.
For example, the type of a variable is inferred based on the type of its initializer:

```ts twoslash
// No type annotation needed -- 'myName' inferred as type 'string'
let myName = "Alice";
```

For the most part you don't need to explicitly learn the rules of inference.
If you're starting out, try using fewer type annotations than you think - you might be surprised how few you need for TypeScript to fully understand what's going on.

## Functions

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript.
TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

### Parameter Type Annotations

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts.
Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:

```ts twoslash
// Parameter type annotation
function greet(name: string) {
  //                 ^^^^^^^^
  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
}
```

When a parameter has a type annotation, arguments to that function will be checked:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
declare function greet(name: string): void;
// ---cut---
// Would be a runtime error if executed!
greet(42);
```

> Even if you don't have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

### Return Type Annotations

You can also add return type annotations.
Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:

```ts twoslash
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
  //                        ^^^^^^^^
  return 26;
}
```

Much like variable type annotations, you usually don't need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the function's return type based on its `return` statements.
The type annotation in the above example doesn't change anything.
Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just for personal preference.

#### Functions Which Return Promises

If you want to annotate the return type of a function which returns a promise, you should use the `Promise` type:

```ts twoslash
async function getFavoriteNumber(): Promise<number> {
  return 26;
}
```

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations.
When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it's going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.

Here's an example:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2551
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];

// Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type string
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});

// Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
names.forEach((s) => {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});
```

Even though the parameter `s` didn't have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

This process is called _contextual typing_ because the _context_ that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

Similar to the inference rules, you don't need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it _does_ happen can help you notice when type annotations aren't needed.
Later, we'll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.

## Object Types

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you'll encounter is an _object type_.
This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them!
To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here's a function that takes a point-like object:

```ts twoslash
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  //                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`.
You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

The type part of each property is also optional.
If you don't specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are _optional_.
To do this, add a `?` after the property name:

```ts twoslash
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: "Bob" });
printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });
```

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error.
Because of this, when you _read_ from an optional property, you'll have to check for `undefined` before using it.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 18048
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

## Union Types

TypeScript's type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators.
Now that we know how to write a few types, it's time to start _combining_ them in interesting ways.

### Defining a Union Type

The first way to combine types you might see is a _union_ type.
A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be _any one_ of those types.
We refer to each of these types as the union's _members_.

Let's write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
// Error
printId({ myID: 22342 });
```

> The separator of the union members is allowed before the first element, so you could also write this:
> ```ts twoslash
> function printTextOrNumberOrBool(
>   textOrNumberOrBool:
>     | string
>     | number
>     | boolean
> ) {
>   console.log(textOrNumberOrBool);
> }
> ```

### Working with Union Types

It's easy to _provide_ a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union's members.
If you _have_ a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for _every_ member of the union.
For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can't use methods that are only available on `string`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log(id.toUpperCase());
}
```

The solution is to _narrow_ the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations.
_Narrowing_ occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:

```ts twoslash
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

Another example is to use a function like `Array.isArray`:

```ts twoslash
function welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {
  if (Array.isArray(x)) {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string[]'
    console.log("Hello, " + x.join(" and "));
  } else {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string'
    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);
  }
}
```

Notice that in the `else` branch, we don't need to do anything special - if `x` wasn't a `string[]`, then it must have been a `string`.

Sometimes you'll have a union where all the members have something in common.
For example, both arrays and strings have a `slice` method.
If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:

```ts twoslash
// Return type is inferred as number[] | string
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {
  return x.slice(0, 3);
}
```

> It might be confusing that a _union_ of types appears to have the _intersection_ of those types' properties.
> This is not an accident - the name _union_ comes from type theory.
> The _union_ `number | string` is composed by taking the union _of the values_ from each type.
> Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the _intersection_ of those facts applies to the _union_ of the sets themselves.
> For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about _every_ person is that they must be wearing a hat.

## Type Aliases

We've been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations.
This is convenient, but it's common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A _type alias_ is exactly that - a _name_ for any _type_.
The syntax for a type alias is:

```ts twoslash
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type.
For example, a type alias can name a union type:

```ts twoslash
type ID = number | string;
```

Note that aliases are _only_ aliases - you cannot use type aliases to create different/distinct "versions" of the same type.
When you use the alias, it's exactly as if you had written the aliased type.
In other words, this code might _look_ illegal, but is OK according to TypeScript because both types are aliases for the same type:

```ts twoslash
declare function getInput(): string;
declare function sanitize(str: string): string;
// ---cut---
type UserInputSanitizedString = string;

function sanitizeInput(str: string): UserInputSanitizedString {
  return sanitize(str);
}

// Create a sanitized input
let userInput = sanitizeInput(getInput());

// Can still be re-assigned with a string though
userInput = "new input";
```

## Interfaces

An _interface declaration_ is another way to name an object type:

```ts twoslash
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

Just like when we used a type alias above, the example works just as if we had used an anonymous object type.
TypeScript is only concerned with the _structure_ of the value we passed to `printCoord` - it only cares that it has the expected properties.
Being concerned only with the structure and capabilities of types is why we call TypeScript a _structurally typed_ type system.

### Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Almost all features of an `interface` are available in `type`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

<div class='table-container'>
<table class='full-width-table'>

}<br/>
interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}<br/>

window.ts.transpileModule(src, {});
        </pre></code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>A type cannot be changed after being created</p>

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}<br/>
<span style="color: #A31515"> // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.</span><br/>
        </pre></code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</div>

You'll learn more about these concepts in later chapters, so don't worry if you don't understand all of these right away.

- Prior to TypeScript version 4.2, type alias names [_may_ appear in error messages](/play?#code/PTAEGEHsFsAcEsA2BTATqNrLusgzngIYDm+oA7koqIYuYQJ56gCueyoAUCKAC4AWHAHaFcoSADMaQ0PCG80EwgGNkALk6c5C1EtWgAsqOi1QAb06groEbjWg8vVHOKcAvpokshy3vEgyyMr8kEbQJogAFND2YREAlOaW1soBeJAoAHSIkMTRmbbI8e6aPMiZxJmgACqCGKhY6ABGyDnkFFQ0dIzMbBwCwqIccabcYLyQoKjIEmh8kwN8DLAc5PzwwbLMyAAeK77IACYaQSEjUWZWhfYAjABMAMwALA+gbsVjoADqgjKESytQPxCHghAByXigYgBfr8LAsYj8aQMUASbDQcRSExCeCwFiIQh+AKfAYyBiQFgOPyIaikSGLQo0Zj-aazaY+dSaXjLDgAGXgAC9CKhDqAALxJaw2Ib2RzOISuDycLw+ImBYKQflCkWRRD2LXCw6JCxS1JCdJZHJ5RAFIbFJU8ADKC3WzEcnVZaGYE1ABpFnFOmsFhsil2uoHuzwArO9SmAAEIsSFrZB-GgAjjA5gtVN8VCEc1o1C4Q4AGlR2AwO1EsBQoAAbvB-gJ4HhPgB5aDwem-Ph1TCV3AEEirTp4ELtRbTPD4vwKjOfAuioSQHuDXBcnmgACC+eCONFEs73YAPGGZVT5cRyyhiHh7AAON7lsG3vBggB8XGV3l8-nVISOgghxoLq9i7io-AHsayRWGaFrlFauq2rg9qaIGQHwCBqChtKdgRo8TxRjeyB3o+7xAA), sometimes in place of the equivalent anonymous type (which may or may not be desirable). Interfaces will always be named in error messages.

- Using interfaces with `extends` [can often be more performant for the compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance#preferring-interfaces-over-intersections) than type aliases with intersections

For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can't know about.

For example, if you're using `document.getElementById`, TypeScript only knows that this will return _some_ kind of `HTMLElement`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a _type assertion_ to specify a more specific type:

```ts twoslash
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
```

Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won't affect the runtime behavior of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx` file), which is equivalent:

```ts twoslash
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```

> Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type assertion.
> There won't be an exception or `null` generated if the type assertion is wrong.

TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a _more specific_ or _less specific_ version of a type.
This rule prevents "impossible" coercions like:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2352
const x = "hello" as number;
```

Sometimes this rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid.
If this happens, you can use two assertions, first to `any` (or `unknown`, which we'll introduce later), then to the desired type:

```ts twoslash
declare const expr: any;
type T = { a: 1; b: 2; c: 3 };
// ---cut---
const a = expr as any as T;
```

## Literal Types

In addition to the general types `string` and `number`, we can refer to _specific_ strings and numbers in type positions.

One way to think about this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both `var` and `let` allow for changing what is held inside the variable, and `const` does not. This is reflected in how TypeScript creates types for literals.

```ts twoslash
let changingString = "Hello World";
changingString = "Olá Mundo";
// Because `changingString` can represent any possible string, that
// is how TypeScript describes it in the type system
changingString;
// ^?

const constantString = "Hello World";
// Because `constantString` can only represent 1 possible string, it
// has a literal type representation
constantString;
// ^?
```

By themselves, literal types aren't very valuable:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
let x: "hello" = "hello";
// OK
x = "hello";
// ...
x = "howdy";
```

It's not much use to have a variable that can only have one value!

But by _combining_ literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that only accept a certain set of known values:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  // ...
}
printText("Hello, world", "left");
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
```

Numeric literal types work the same way:

```ts twoslash
function compare(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1 {
  return a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
}
```

Of course, you can combine these with non-literal types:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface Options {
  width: number;
}
function configure(x: Options | "auto") {
  // ...
}
configure({ width: 100 });
configure("auto");
configure("automatic");
```

There's one more kind of literal type: boolean literals.
There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might guess, they are the types `true` and `false`.
The type `boolean` itself is actually just an alias for the union `true | false`.

### Literal Inference

When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values later.
For example, if you wrote code like this:

```ts twoslash
declare const someCondition: boolean;
// ---cut---
const obj = { counter: 0 };
if (someCondition) {
  obj.counter = 1;
}
```

TypeScript doesn't assume the assignment of `1` to a field which previously had `0` is an error.
Another way of saying this is that `obj.counter` must have the type `number`, not `0`, because types are used to determine both _reading_ and _writing_ behavior.

The same applies to strings:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;

const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
```

In the above example `req.method` is inferred to be `string`, not `"GET"`. Because code can be evaluated between the creation of `req` and the call of `handleRequest` which could assign a new string like `"GUESS"` to `req.method`, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

1. You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:

   ```ts twoslash
   declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;
   // ---cut---
   // Change 1:
   const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };
   // Change 2
   handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");
   ```

   Change 1 means "I intend for `req.method` to always have the _literal type_ `"GET"`", preventing the possible assignment of `"GUESS"` to that field after.
   Change 2 means "I know for other reasons that `req.method` has the value `"GET"`".

2. You can use `as const` to convert the entire object to be type literals:

   ```ts twoslash
   declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;
   // ---cut---
   const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;
   handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
   ```

The `as const` suffix acts like `const` but for the type system, ensuring that all properties are assigned the literal type instead of a more general version like `string` or `number`.

## `null` and `undefined`

JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

TypeScript has two corresponding _types_ by the same names. How these types behave depends on whether you have the [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) option on.

### `strictNullChecks` off

With [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) _off_, values that might be `null` or `undefined` can still be accessed normally, and the values `null` and `undefined` can be assigned to a property of any type.
This is similar to how languages without null checks (e.g. C#, Java) behave.
The lack of checking for these values tends to be a major source of bugs; we always recommend people turn [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) on if it's practical to do so in their codebase.

### `strictNullChecks` on

With [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) _on_, when a value is `null` or `undefined`, you will need to test for those values before using methods or properties on that value.
Just like checking for `undefined` before using an optional property, we can use _narrowing_ to check for values that might be `null`:

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(x: string | null) {
  if (x === null) {
    // do nothing
  } else {
    console.log("Hello, " + x.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

### Non-null Assertion Operator (Postfix `!`)

TypeScript also has a special syntax for removing `null` and `undefined` from a type without doing any explicit checking.
Writing `!` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn't `null` or `undefined`:

```ts twoslash
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  // No error
  console.log(x!.toFixed());
}
```

Just like other type assertions, this doesn't change the runtime behavior of your code, so it's important to only use `!` when you know that the value _can't_ be `null` or `undefined`.

## Enums

Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants. Unlike most TypeScript features, this is _not_ a type-level addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime. Because of this, it's a feature which you should know exists, but maybe hold off on using unless you are sure. You can read more about enums in the [Enum reference page](/docs/handbook/enums.html).

## Less Common Primitives

It's worth mentioning the rest of the primitives in JavaScript which are represented in the type system.
Though we will not go into depth here.

#### `bigint`

From ES2020 onwards, there is a primitive in JavaScript used for very large integers, `BigInt`:

```ts twoslash
// @target: es2020

// Creating a bigint via the BigInt function
const oneHundred: bigint = BigInt(100);

// Creating a BigInt via the literal syntax
const anotherHundred: bigint = 100n;
```

You can learn more about BigInt in [the TypeScript 3.2 release notes](/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-2.html#bigint).

#### `symbol`

There is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function `Symbol()`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2367
const firstName = Symbol("name");
const secondName = Symbol("name");

if (firstName === secondName) {
  // Can't ever happen
}
```

You can learn more about them in [Symbols reference page](/docs/handbook/symbols.html).

Imagine we have a function called `padLeft`.

```ts twoslash
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  throw new Error("Not implemented yet!");
}
```

If `padding` is a `number`, it will treat that as the number of spaces we want to prepend to `input`.
If `padding` is a `string`, it should just prepend `padding` to `input`.
Let's try to implement the logic for when `padLeft` is passed a `number` for `padding`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
}
```

Uh-oh, we're getting an error on `padding`.
TypeScript is warning us that we're passing a value with type `number | string` to the `repeat` function, which only accepts a `number`, and it's right.
In other words, we haven't explicitly checked if `padding` is a `number` first, nor are we handling the case where it's a `string`, so let's do exactly that.

```ts twoslash
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }
  return padding + input;
}
```

If this mostly looks like uninteresting JavaScript code, that's sort of the point.
Apart from the annotations we put in place, this TypeScript code looks like JavaScript.
The idea is that TypeScript's type system aims to make it as easy as possible to write typical JavaScript code without bending over backwards to get type safety.

While it might not look like much, there's actually a lot going on under the covers here.
Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript's runtime control flow constructs like `if/else`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all affect those types.

Within our `if` check, TypeScript sees `typeof padding === "number"` and understands that as a special form of code called a _type guard_.
TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position.
It looks at these special checks (called _type guards_) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is called _narrowing_.
In many editors we can observe these types as they change, and we'll even do so in our examples.

```ts twoslash
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
    //                ^?
  }
  return padding + input;
  //     ^?
}
```

There are a couple of different constructs TypeScript understands for narrowing.

## `typeof` type guards

As we've seen, JavaScript supports a `typeof` operator which can give very basic information about the type of values we have at runtime.
TypeScript expects this to return a certain set of strings:

- `"string"`
- `"number"`
- `"bigint"`
- `"boolean"`
- `"symbol"`
- `"undefined"`
- `"object"`
- `"function"`

Like we saw with `padLeft`, this operator comes up pretty often in a number of JavaScript libraries, and TypeScript can understand it to narrow types in different branches.

In TypeScript, checking against the value returned by `typeof` is a type guard.
Because TypeScript encodes how `typeof` operates on different values, it knows about some of its quirks in JavaScript.
For example, notice that in the list above, `typeof` doesn't return the string `null`.
Check out the following example:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2531 18047
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (typeof strs === "object") {
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s);
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
    console.log(strs);
  } else {
    // do nothing
  }
}
```

In the `printAll` function, we try to check if `strs` is an object to see if it's an array type (now might be a good time to reinforce that arrays are object types in JavaScript).
But it turns out that in JavaScript, `typeof null` is actually `"object"`!
This is one of those unfortunate accidents of history.

Users with enough experience might not be surprised, but not everyone has run into this in JavaScript; luckily, TypeScript lets us know that `strs` was only narrowed down to `string[] | null` instead of just `string[]`.

This might be a good segue into what we'll call "truthiness" checking.

## Truthiness narrowing

Truthiness might not be a word you'll find in the dictionary, but it's very much something you'll hear about in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, we can use any expression in conditionals, `&&`s, `||`s, `if` statements, Boolean negations (`!`), and more.
As an example, `if` statements don't expect their condition to always have the type `boolean`.

```ts twoslash
function getUsersOnlineMessage(numUsersOnline: number) {
  if (numUsersOnline) {
    return `There are ${numUsersOnline} online now!`;
  }
  return "Nobody's here. :(";
}
```

In JavaScript, constructs like `if` first "coerce" their conditions to `boolean`s to make sense of them, and then choose their branches depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`.
Values like

- `0`
- `NaN`
- `""` (the empty string)
- `0n` (the `bigint` version of zero)
- `null`
- `undefined`

all coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced to `true`.
You can always coerce values to `boolean`s by running them through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation. (The latter has the advantage that TypeScript infers a narrow literal boolean type `true`, while inferring the first as type `boolean`.)

```ts twoslash
// both of these result in 'true'
Boolean("hello"); // type: boolean, value: true
!!"world"; // type: true,    value: true
```

It's fairly popular to leverage this behavior, especially for guarding against values like `null` or `undefined`.
As an example, let's try using it for our `printAll` function.

```ts twoslash
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (strs && typeof strs === "object") {
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s);
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
    console.log(strs);
  }
}
```

You'll notice that we've gotten rid of the error above by checking if `strs` is truthy.
This at least prevents us from dreaded errors when we run our code like:

```txt
TypeError: null is not iterable
```

Keep in mind though that truthiness checking on primitives can often be error prone.
As an example, consider a different attempt at writing `printAll`

```ts twoslash {class: "do-not-do-this"}
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  //  DON'T DO THIS!
  //   KEEP READING
  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  if (strs) {
    if (typeof strs === "object") {
      for (const s of strs) {
        console.log(s);
      }
    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
      console.log(strs);
    }
  }
}
```

We wrapped the entire body of the function in a truthy check, but this has a subtle downside: we may no longer be handling the empty string case correctly.

TypeScript doesn't hurt us here at all, but this behavior is worth noting if you're less familiar with JavaScript.
TypeScript can often help you catch bugs early on, but if you choose to do _nothing_ with a value, there's only so much that it can do without being overly prescriptive.
If you want, you can make sure you handle situations like these with a linter.

One last word on narrowing by truthiness is that Boolean negations with `!` filter out from negated branches.

```ts twoslash
function multiplyAll(
  values: number[] | undefined,
  factor: number
): number[] | undefined {
  if (!values) {
    return values;
  } else {
    return values.map((x) => x * factor);
  }
}
```

## Equality narrowing

TypeScript also uses `switch` statements and equality checks like `===`, `!==`, `==`, and `!=` to narrow types.
For example:

```ts twoslash
function example(x: string | number, y: string | boolean) {
  if (x === y) {
    // We can now call any 'string' method on 'x' or 'y'.
    x.toUpperCase();
    // ^?
    y.toLowerCase();
    // ^?
  } else {
    console.log(x);
    //          ^?
    console.log(y);
    //          ^?
  }
}
```

When we checked that `x` and `y` are both equal in the above example, TypeScript knew their types also had to be equal.
Since `string` is the only common type that both `x` and `y` could take on, TypeScript knows that `x` and `y` must be `string`s in the first branch.

Checking against specific literal values (as opposed to variables) works also.
In our section about truthiness narrowing, we wrote a `printAll` function which was error-prone because it accidentally didn't handle empty strings properly.
Instead we could have done a specific check to block out `null`s, and TypeScript still correctly removes `null` from the type of `strs`.

```ts twoslash
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (strs !== null) {
    if (typeof strs === "object") {
      for (const s of strs) {
        //            ^?
        console.log(s);
      }
    } else if (typeof strs === "string") {
      console.log(strs);
      //          ^?
    }
  }
}
```

JavaScript's looser equality checks with `==` and `!=` also get narrowed correctly.
If you're unfamiliar, checking whether something `== null` actually not only checks whether it is specifically the value `null` - it also checks whether it's potentially `undefined`.
The same applies to `== undefined`: it checks whether a value is either `null` or `undefined`.

```ts twoslash
interface Container {
  value: number | null | undefined;
}

function multiplyValue(container: Container, factor: number) {
  // Remove both 'null' and 'undefined' from the type.
  if (container.value != null) {
    console.log(container.value);
    //                    ^?

    // Now we can safely multiply 'container.value'.
    container.value *= factor;
  }
}
```

## The `in` operator narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for determining if an object or its prototype chain has a property with a name: the `in` operator.
TypeScript takes this into account as a way to narrow down potential types.

For example, with the code: `"value" in x` where `"value"` is a string literal and `x` is a union type.
The "true" branch narrows `x`'s types which have either an optional or required property `value`, and the "false" branch narrows to types which have an optional or missing property `value`.

```ts twoslash
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };

function move(animal: Fish | Bird) {
  if ("swim" in animal) {
    return animal.swim();
  }

  return animal.fly();
}
```

To reiterate, optional properties will exist in both sides for narrowing. For example, a human could both swim and fly (with the right equipment) and thus should show up in both sides of the `in` check:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts twoslash
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
type Human = { swim?: () => void; fly?: () => void };

function move(animal: Fish | Bird | Human) {
  if ("swim" in animal) {
    animal;
//  ^?
  } else {
    animal;
//  ^?
  }
}
```

## `instanceof` narrowing

JavaScript has an operator for checking whether or not a value is an "instance" of another value.
More specifically, in JavaScript `x instanceof Foo` checks whether the _prototype chain_ of `x` contains `Foo.prototype`.
While we won't dive deep here, and you'll see more of this when we get into classes, they can still be useful for most values that can be constructed with `new`.
As you might have guessed, `instanceof` is also a type guard, and TypeScript narrows in branches guarded by `instanceof`s.

```ts twoslash
function logValue(x: Date | string) {
  if (x instanceof Date) {
    console.log(x.toUTCString());
    //          ^?
  } else {
    console.log(x.toUpperCase());
    //          ^?
  }
}
```

## Assignments

As we mentioned earlier, when we assign to any variable, TypeScript looks at the right side of the assignment and narrows the left side appropriately.

```ts twoslash
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";
//  ^?
x = 1;

console.log(x);
//          ^?
x = "goodbye!";

console.log(x);
//          ^?
```

Notice that each of these assignments is valid.
Even though the observed type of `x` changed to `number` after our first assignment, we were still able to assign a `string` to `x`.
This is because the _declared type_ of `x` - the type that `x` started with - is `string | number`, and assignability is always checked against the declared type.

If we'd assigned a `boolean` to `x`, we'd have seen an error since that wasn't part of the declared type.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
let x = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 10 : "hello world!";
//  ^?
x = 1;

console.log(x);
//          ^?
x = true;

console.log(x);
//          ^?
```

## Control flow analysis

Up until this point, we've gone through some basic examples of how TypeScript narrows within specific branches.
But there's a bit more going on than just walking up from every variable and looking for type guards in `if`s, `while`s, conditionals, etc.
For example

```ts twoslash
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }
  return padding + input;
}
```

`padLeft` returns from within its first `if` block.
TypeScript was able to analyze this code and see that the rest of the body (`return padding + input;`) is _unreachable_ in the case where `padding` is a `number`.
As a result, it was able to remove `number` from the type of `padding` (narrowing from `string | number` to `string`) for the rest of the function.

This analysis of code based on reachability is called _control flow analysis_, and TypeScript uses this flow analysis to narrow types as it encounters type guards and assignments.
When a variable is analyzed, control flow can split off and re-merge over and over again, and that variable can be observed to have a different type at each point.

```ts twoslash
function example() {
  let x: string | number | boolean;

  x = Math.random() < 0.5;

  console.log(x);
  //          ^?

  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    x = "hello";
    console.log(x);
    //          ^?
  } else {
    x = 100;
    console.log(x);
    //          ^?
  }

  return x;
  //     ^?
}
```

## Using type predicates

We've worked with existing JavaScript constructs to handle narrowing so far, however sometimes you want more direct control over how types change throughout your code.

To define a user-defined type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a _type predicate_:

```ts twoslash
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
declare function getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird;
// ---cut---
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
```

`pet is Fish` is our type predicate in this example.
A predicate takes the form `parameterName is Type`, where `parameterName` must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.

Any time `isFish` is called with some variable, TypeScript will _narrow_ that variable to that specific type if the original type is compatible.

```ts twoslash
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
declare function getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird;
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
// ---cut---
// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.
let pet = getSmallPet();

if (isFish(pet)) {
  pet.swim();
} else {
  pet.fly();
}
```

Notice that TypeScript not only knows that `pet` is a `Fish` in the `if` branch;
it also knows that in the `else` branch, you _don't_ have a `Fish`, so you must have a `Bird`.

You may use the type guard `isFish` to filter an array of `Fish | Bird` and obtain an array of `Fish`:

```ts twoslash
type Fish = { swim: () => void; name: string };
type Bird = { fly: () => void; name: string };
declare function getSmallPet(): Fish | Bird;
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
// ---cut---
const zoo: (Fish | Bird)[] = [getSmallPet(), getSmallPet(), getSmallPet()];
const underWater1: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish);
// or, equivalently
const underWater2: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish) as Fish[];

// The predicate may need repeating for more complex examples
const underWater3: Fish[] = zoo.filter((pet): pet is Fish => {
  if (pet.name === "sharkey") return false;
  return isFish(pet);
});
```

In addition, classes can [use `this is Type`](/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#this-based-type-guards) to narrow their type.

## Assertion functions

Types can also be narrowed using [Assertion functions](/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions).

# Discriminated unions

Most of the examples we've looked at so far have focused around narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`, `boolean`, and `number`.
While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript we'll be dealing with slightly more complex structures.

For some motivation, let's imagine we're trying to encode shapes like circles and squares.
Circles keep track of their radiuses and squares keep track of their side lengths.
We'll use a field called `kind` to tell which shape we're dealing with.
Here's a first attempt at defining `Shape`.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}
```

Notice we're using a union of string literal types: `"circle"` and `"square"` to tell us whether we should treat the shape as a circle or square respectively.
By using `"circle" | "square"` instead of `string`, we can avoid misspelling issues.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2367
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function handleShape(shape: Shape) {
  // oops!
  if (shape.kind === "rect") {
    // ...
  }
}
```

We can write a `getArea` function that applies the right logic based on if it's dealing with a circle or square.
We'll first try dealing with circles.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2532 18048
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
}
```

<!-- TODO -->

Under [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) that gives us an error - which is appropriate since `radius` might not be defined.
But what if we perform the appropriate checks on the `kind` property?

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2532 18048
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === "circle") {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  }
}
```

Hmm, TypeScript still doesn't know what to do here.
We've hit a point where we know more about our values than the type checker does.
We could try to use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely present.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === "circle") {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;
  }
}
```

But this doesn't feel ideal.
We had to shout a bit at the type-checker with those non-null assertions (`!`) to convince it that `shape.radius` was defined, but those assertions are error-prone if we start to move code around.
Additionally, outside of [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) we're able to accidentally access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them).
We can definitely do better.

The problem with this encoding of `Shape` is that the type-checker doesn't have any way to know whether or not `radius` or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property.
We need to communicate what _we_ know to the type checker.
With that in mind, let's take another swing at defining `Shape`.

```ts twoslash
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

Here, we've properly separated `Shape` out into two types with different values for the `kind` property, but `radius` and `sideLength` are declared as required properties in their respective types.

Let's see what happens here when we try to access the `radius` of a `Shape`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
}
```

Like with our first definition of `Shape`, this is still an error.
When `radius` was optional, we got an error (with [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) enabled) because TypeScript couldn't tell whether the property was present.
Now that `Shape` is a union, TypeScript is telling us that `shape` might be a `Square`, and `Square`s don't have `radius` defined on them!
Both interpretations are correct, but only the union encoding of `Shape` will cause an error regardless of how [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) is configured.

But what if we tried checking the `kind` property again?

```ts twoslash
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === "circle") {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    //               ^?
  }
}
```

That got rid of the error!
When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types, TypeScript considers that to be a _discriminated union_, and can narrow out the members of the union.

In this case, `kind` was that common property (which is what's considered a _discriminant_ property of `Shape`).
Checking whether the `kind` property was `"circle"` got rid of every type in `Shape` that didn't have a `kind` property with the type `"circle"`.
That narrowed `shape` down to the type `Circle`.

The same checking works with `switch` statements as well.
Now we can try to write our complete `getArea` without any pesky `!` non-null assertions.

```ts twoslash
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

// ---cut---
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    //                 ^?
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    //       ^?
  }
}
```

The important thing here was the encoding of `Shape`.
Communicating the right information to TypeScript - that `Circle` and `Square` were really two separate types with specific `kind` fields - was crucial.
Doing that lets us write type-safe TypeScript code that looks no different than the JavaScript we would've written otherwise.
From there, the type system was able to do the "right" thing and figure out the types in each branch of our `switch` statement.

> As an aside, try playing around with the above example and remove some of the return keywords.
> You'll see that type-checking can help avoid bugs when accidentally falling through different clauses in a `switch` statement.

Discriminated unions are useful for more than just talking about circles and squares.
They're good for representing any sort of messaging scheme in JavaScript, like when sending messages over the network (client/server communication), or encoding mutations in a state management framework.

# The `never` type

When narrowing, you can reduce the options of a union to a point where you have removed all possibilities and have nothing left.
In those cases, TypeScript will use a `never` type to represent a state which shouldn't exist.

# Exhaustiveness checking

The `never` type is assignable to every type; however, no type is assignable to `never` (except `never` itself). This means you can use narrowing and rely on `never` turning up to do exhaustive checking in a `switch` statement.

For example, adding a `default` to our `getArea` function which tries to assign the shape to `never` will not raise an error when every possible case has been handled.

```ts twoslash
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}
// ---cut---
type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

Adding a new member to the `Shape` union, will cause a TypeScript error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}
// ---cut---
interface Triangle {
  kind: "triangle";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they're local functions, imported from another module, or methods on a class.
They're also values, and just like other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.
Let's learn about how to write types that describe functions.

## Function Type Expressions

The simplest way to describe a function is with a _function type expression_.
These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:

```ts twoslash
function greeter(fn: (a: string) => void) {
  fn("Hello, World");
}

function printToConsole(s: string) {
  console.log(s);
}

greeter(printToConsole);
```

The syntax `(a: string) => void` means "a function with one parameter, named `a`, of type `string`, that doesn't have a return value".
Just like with function declarations, if a parameter type isn't specified, it's implicitly `any`.

> Note that the parameter name is **required**. The function type `(string) => void` means "a function with a parameter named `string` of type `any`"!

Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:

```ts twoslash
type GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;
function greeter(fn: GreetFunction) {
  // ...
}
```

## Call Signatures

In JavaScript, functions can have properties in addition to being callable.
However, the function type expression syntax doesn't allow for declaring properties.
If we want to describe something callable with properties, we can write a _call signature_ in an object type:

```ts twoslash
type DescribableFunction = {
  description: string;
  (someArg: number): boolean;
};
function doSomething(fn: DescribableFunction) {
  console.log(fn.description + " returned " + fn(6));
}

function myFunc(someArg: number) {
  return someArg > 3;
}
myFunc.description = "default description";

doSomething(myFunc);
```

Note that the syntax is slightly different compared to a function type expression - use `:` between the parameter list and the return type rather than `=>`.

## Construct Signatures

JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new` operator.
TypeScript refers to these as _constructors_ because they usually create a new object.
You can write a _construct signature_ by adding the `new` keyword in front of a call signature:

```ts twoslash
type SomeObject = any;
// ---cut---
type SomeConstructor = {
  new (s: string): SomeObject;
};
function fn(ctor: SomeConstructor) {
  return new ctor("hello");
}
```

Some objects, like JavaScript's `Date` object, can be called with or without `new`.
You can combine call and construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:

```ts twoslash
interface CallOrConstruct {
  (n?: number): string;
  new (s: string): Date;
}

function fn(ctor: CallOrConstruct) {
  // Passing an argument of type `number` to `ctor` matches it against
  // the first definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.
  console.log(ctor(10));
              // ^?

  // Similarly, passing an argument of type `string` to `ctor` matches it
  // against the second definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.
  console.log(new ctor("10"));
                  // ^?
}

fn(Date);
```

## Generic Functions

It's common to write a function where the types of the input relate to the type of the output, or where the types of two inputs are related in some way.
Let's consider for a moment a function that returns the first element of an array:

```ts twoslash
function firstElement(arr: any[]) {
  return arr[0];
}
```

This function does its job, but unfortunately has the return type `any`.
It'd be better if the function returned the type of the array element.

In TypeScript, _generics_ are used when we want to describe a correspondence between two values.
We do this by declaring a _type parameter_ in the function signature:

```ts twoslash
function firstElement<Type>(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined {
  return arr[0];
}
```

By adding a type parameter `Type` to this function and using it in two places, we've created a link between the input of the function (the array) and the output (the return value).
Now when we call it, a more specific type comes out:

```ts twoslash
declare function firstElement<Type>(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined;
// ---cut---
// s is of type 'string'
const s = firstElement(["a", "b", "c"]);
// n is of type 'number'
const n = firstElement([1, 2, 3]);
// u is of type undefined
const u = firstElement([]);
```

### Inference

Note that we didn't have to specify `Type` in this sample.
The type was _inferred_ - chosen automatically - by TypeScript.

We can use multiple type parameters as well.
For example, a standalone version of `map` would look like this:

```ts twoslash
// prettier-ignore
function map<Input, Output>(arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[] {
  return arr.map(func);
}

// Parameter 'n' is of type 'string'
// 'parsed' is of type 'number[]'
const parsed = map(["1", "2", "3"], (n) => parseInt(n));
```

Note that in this example, TypeScript could infer both the type of the `Input` type parameter (from the given `string` array), as well as the `Output` type parameter based on the return value of the function expression (`number`).

### Constraints

We've written some generic functions that can work on _any_ kind of value.
Sometimes we want to relate two values, but can only operate on a certain subset of values.
In this case, we can use a _constraint_ to limit the kinds of types that a type parameter can accept.

Let's write a function that returns the longer of two values.
To do this, we need a `length` property that's a number.
We _constrain_ the type parameter to that type by writing an `extends` clause:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345 2322
function longest<Type extends { length: number }>(a: Type, b: Type) {
  if (a.length >= b.length) {
    return a;
  } else {
    return b;
  }
}

// longerArray is of type 'number[]'
const longerArray = longest([1, 2], [1, 2, 3]);
// longerString is of type 'alice' | 'bob'
const longerString = longest("alice", "bob");
// Error! Numbers don't have a 'length' property
const notOK = longest(10, 100);
```

There are a few interesting things to note in this example.
We allowed TypeScript to _infer_ the return type of `longest`.
Return type inference also works on generic functions.

Because we constrained `Type` to `{ length: number }`, we were allowed to access the `.length` property of the `a` and `b` parameters.
Without the type constraint, we wouldn't be able to access those properties because the values might have been some other type without a length property.

The types of `longerArray` and `longerString` were inferred based on the arguments.
Remember, generics are all about relating two or more values with the same type!

Finally, just as we'd like, the call to `longest(10, 100)` is rejected because the `number` type doesn't have a `.length` property.

### Working with Constrained Values

Here's a common error when working with generic constraints:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
function minimumLength<Type extends { length: number }>(
  obj: Type,
  minimum: number
): Type {
  if (obj.length >= minimum) {
    return obj;
  } else {
    return { length: minimum };
  }
}
```

It might look like this function is OK - `Type` is constrained to `{ length: number }`, and the function either returns `Type` or a value matching that constraint.
The problem is that the function promises to return the _same_ kind of object as was passed in, not just _some_ object matching the constraint.
If this code were legal, you could write code that definitely wouldn't work:

```ts twoslash
declare function minimumLength<Type extends { length: number }>(
  obj: Type,
  minimum: number
): Type;
// ---cut---
// 'arr' gets value { length: 6 }
const arr = minimumLength([1, 2, 3], 6);
// and crashes here because arrays have
// a 'slice' method, but not the returned object!
console.log(arr.slice(0));
```

### Specifying Type Arguments

TypeScript can usually infer the intended type arguments in a generic call, but not always.
For example, let's say you wrote a function to combine two arrays:

```ts twoslash
function combine<Type>(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[] {
  return arr1.concat(arr2);
}
```

Normally it would be an error to call this function with mismatched arrays:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
declare function combine<Type>(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[];
// ---cut---
const arr = combine([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);
```

If you intended to do this, however, you could manually specify `Type`:

```ts twoslash
declare function combine<Type>(arr1: Type[], arr2: Type[]): Type[];
// ---cut---
const arr = combine<string | number>([1, 2, 3], ["hello"]);
```

### Guidelines for Writing Good Generic Functions

Writing generic functions is fun, and it can be easy to get carried away with type parameters.
Having too many type parameters or using constraints where they aren't needed can make inference less successful, frustrating callers of your function.

#### Push Type Parameters Down

Here are two ways of writing a function that appear similar:

```ts twoslash
function firstElement1<Type>(arr: Type[]) {
  return arr[0];
}

function firstElement2<Type extends any[]>(arr: Type) {
  return arr[0];
}

// a: number (good)
const a = firstElement1([1, 2, 3]);
// b: any (bad)
const b = firstElement2([1, 2, 3]);
```

These might seem identical at first glance, but `firstElement1` is a much better way to write this function.
Its inferred return type is `Type`, but `firstElement2`'s inferred return type is `any` because TypeScript has to resolve the `arr[0]` expression using the constraint type, rather than "waiting" to resolve the element during a call.

> **Rule**: When possible, use the type parameter itself rather than constraining it

#### Use Fewer Type Parameters

Here's another pair of similar functions:

```ts twoslash
function filter1<Type>(arr: Type[], func: (arg: Type) => boolean): Type[] {
  return arr.filter(func);
}

function filter2<Type, Func extends (arg: Type) => boolean>(
  arr: Type[],
  func: Func
): Type[] {
  return arr.filter(func);
}
```

We've created a type parameter `Func` that _doesn't relate two values_.
That's always a red flag, because it means callers wanting to specify type arguments have to manually specify an extra type argument for no reason.
`Func` doesn't do anything but make the function harder to read and reason about!

> **Rule**: Always use as few type parameters as possible

#### Type Parameters Should Appear Twice

Sometimes we forget that a function might not need to be generic:

```ts twoslash
function greet<Str extends string>(s: Str) {
  console.log("Hello, " + s);
}

greet("world");
```

We could just as easily have written a simpler version:

```ts twoslash
function greet(s: string) {
  console.log("Hello, " + s);
}
```

Remember, type parameters are for _relating the types of multiple values_.
If a type parameter is only used once in the function signature, it's not relating anything.
This includes the inferred return type; for example, if `Str` was part of the inferred return type of `greet`, it would be relating the argument and return types, so would be used _twice_ despite appearing only once in the written code.

> **Rule**: If a type parameter only appears in one location, strongly reconsider if you actually need it

## Optional Parameters

Functions in JavaScript often take a variable number of arguments.
For example, the `toFixed` method of `number` takes an optional digit count:

```ts twoslash
function f(n: number) {
  console.log(n.toFixed()); // 0 arguments
  console.log(n.toFixed(3)); // 1 argument
}
```

We can model this in TypeScript by marking the parameter as _optional_ with `?`:

```ts twoslash
function f(x?: number) {
  // ...
}
f(); // OK
f(10); // OK
```

Although the parameter is specified as type `number`, the `x` parameter will actually have the type `number | undefined` because unspecified parameters in JavaScript get the value `undefined`.

You can also provide a parameter _default_:

```ts twoslash
function f(x = 10) {
  // ...
}
```

Now in the body of `f`, `x` will have type `number` because any `undefined` argument will be replaced with `10`.
Note that when a parameter is optional, callers can always pass `undefined`, as this simply simulates a "missing" argument:

```ts twoslash
declare function f(x?: number): void;
// ---cut---
// All OK
f();
f(10);
f(undefined);
```

### Optional Parameters in Callbacks

Once you've learned about optional parameters and function type expressions, it's very easy to make the following mistakes when writing functions that invoke callbacks:

```ts twoslash
function myForEach(arr: any[], callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    callback(arr[i], i);
  }
}
```

What people usually intend when writing `index?` as an optional parameter is that they want both of these calls to be legal:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2532 18048
declare function myForEach(
  arr: any[],
  callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void
): void;
// ---cut---
myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a) => console.log(a));
myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => console.log(a, i));
```

What this _actually_ means is that _`callback` might get invoked with one argument_.
In other words, the function definition says that the implementation might look like this:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2532 18048
function myForEach(arr: any[], callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // I don't feel like providing the index today
    callback(arr[i]);
  }
}
```

In turn, TypeScript will enforce this meaning and issue errors that aren't really possible:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2532 18048
declare function myForEach(
  arr: any[],
  callback: (arg: any, index?: number) => void
): void;
// ---cut---
myForEach([1, 2, 3], (a, i) => {
  console.log(i.toFixed());
});
```

In JavaScript, if you call a function with more arguments than there are parameters, the extra arguments are simply ignored.
TypeScript behaves the same way.
Functions with fewer parameters (of the same types) can always take the place of functions with more parameters.

> **Rule**: When writing a function type for a callback, _never_ write an optional parameter unless you intend to _call_ the function without passing that argument

## Function Overloads

Some JavaScript functions can be called in a variety of argument counts and types.
For example, you might write a function to produce a `Date` that takes either a timestamp (one argument) or a month/day/year specification (three arguments).

In TypeScript, we can specify a function that can be called in different ways by writing _overload signatures_.
To do this, write some number of function signatures (usually two or more), followed by the body of the function:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2575
function makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;
function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date;
function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {
  if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) {
    return new Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d);
  } else {
    return new Date(mOrTimestamp);
  }
}
const d1 = makeDate(12345678);
const d2 = makeDate(5, 5, 5);
const d3 = makeDate(1, 3);
```

In this example, we wrote two overloads: one accepting one argument, and another accepting three arguments.
These first two signatures are called the _overload signatures_.

Then, we wrote a function implementation with a compatible signature.
Functions have an _implementation_ signature, but this signature can't be called directly.
Even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the required one, it can't be called with two parameters!

### Overload Signatures and the Implementation Signature

This is a common source of confusion.
Often people will write code like this and not understand why there is an error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2554
function fn(x: string): void;
function fn() {
  // ...
}
// Expected to be able to call with zero arguments
fn();
```

Again, the signature used to write the function body can't be "seen" from the outside.

> The signature of the _implementation_ is not visible from the outside.
> When writing an overloaded function, you should always have _two_ or more signatures above the implementation of the function.

The implementation signature must also be _compatible_ with the overload signatures.
For example, these functions have errors because the implementation signature doesn't match the overloads in a correct way:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2394
function fn(x: boolean): void;
// Argument type isn't right
function fn(x: string): void;
function fn(x: boolean) {}
```

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2394
function fn(x: string): string;
// Return type isn't right
function fn(x: number): boolean;
function fn(x: string | number) {
  return "oops";
}
```

### Writing Good Overloads

Like generics, there are a few guidelines you should follow when using function overloads.
Following these principles will make your function easier to call, easier to understand, and easier to implement.

Let's consider a function that returns the length of a string or an array:

```ts twoslash
function len(s: string): number;
function len(arr: any[]): number;
function len(x: any) {
  return x.length;
}
```

This function is fine; we can invoke it with strings or arrays.
However, we can't invoke it with a value that might be a string _or_ an array, because TypeScript can only resolve a function call to a single overload:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2769
declare function len(s: string): number;
declare function len(arr: any[]): number;
// ---cut---
len(""); // OK
len([0]); // OK
len(Math.random() > 0.5 ? "hello" : [0]);
```

Because both overloads have the same argument count and same return type, we can instead write a non-overloaded version of the function:

```ts twoslash
function len(x: any[] | string) {
  return x.length;
}
```

This is much better!
Callers can invoke this with either sort of value, and as an added bonus, we don't have to figure out a correct implementation signature.

> Always prefer parameters with union types instead of overloads when possible

## Declaring `this` in a Function

TypeScript will infer what the `this` should be in a function via code flow analysis, for example in the following:

```ts twoslash
const user = {
  id: 123,

  admin: false,
  becomeAdmin: function () {
    this.admin = true;
  },
};
```

TypeScript understands that the function `user.becomeAdmin` has a corresponding `this` which is the outer object `user`. `this`, _heh_, can be enough for a lot of cases, but there are a lot of cases where you need more control over what object `this` represents. The JavaScript specification states that you cannot have a parameter called `this`, and so TypeScript uses that syntax space to let you declare the type for `this` in the function body.

```ts twoslash
interface User {
  id: number;
  admin: boolean;
}
declare const getDB: () => DB;
// ---cut---
interface DB {
  filterUsers(filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];
}

const db = getDB();
const admins = db.filterUsers(function (this: User) {
  return this.admin;
});
```

This pattern is common with callback-style APIs, where another object typically controls when your function is called. Note that you need to use `function` and not arrow functions to get this behavior:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 7041 7017
interface User {
  id: number;
  admin: boolean;
}
declare const getDB: () => DB;
// ---cut---
interface DB {
  filterUsers(filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];
}

const db = getDB();
const admins = db.filterUsers(() => this.admin);
```

## Other Types to Know About

There are some additional types you'll want to recognize that appear often when working with function types.
Like all types, you can use them everywhere, but these are especially relevant in the context of functions.

### `void`

`void` represents the return value of functions which don't return a value.
It's the inferred type any time a function doesn't have any `return` statements, or doesn't return any explicit value from those return statements:

```ts twoslash
// The inferred return type is void
function noop() {
  return;
}
```

In JavaScript, a function that doesn't return any value will implicitly return the value `undefined`.
However, `void` and `undefined` are not the same thing in TypeScript.
There are further details at the end of this chapter.

> `void` is not the same as `undefined`.

### `object`

The special type `object` refers to any value that isn't a primitive (`string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`).
This is different from the _empty object type_ `{ }`, and also different from the global type `Object`.
It's very likely you will never use `Object`.

> `object` is not `Object`. **Always** use `object`!

Note that in JavaScript, function values are objects: They have properties, have `Object.prototype` in their prototype chain, are `instanceof Object`, you can call `Object.keys` on them, and so on.
For this reason, function types are considered to be `object`s in TypeScript.

### `unknown`

The `unknown` type represents _any_ value.
This is similar to the `any` type, but is safer because it's not legal to do anything with an `unknown` value:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2571 18046
function f1(a: any) {
  a.b(); // OK
}
function f2(a: unknown) {
  a.b();
}
```

This is useful when describing function types because you can describe functions that accept any value without having `any` values in your function body.

Conversely, you can describe a function that returns a value of unknown type:

```ts twoslash
declare const someRandomString: string;
// ---cut---
function safeParse(s: string): unknown {
  return JSON.parse(s);
}

// Need to be careful with 'obj'!
const obj = safeParse(someRandomString);
```

### `never`

Some functions _never_ return a value:

```ts twoslash
function fail(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);
}
```

The `never` type represents values which are _never_ observed.
In a return type, this means that the function throws an exception or terminates execution of the program.

`never` also appears when TypeScript determines there's nothing left in a union.

```ts twoslash
function fn(x: string | number) {
  if (typeof x === "string") {
    // do something
  } else if (typeof x === "number") {
    // do something else
  } else {
    x; // has type 'never'!
  }
}
```

### `Function`

The global type `Function` describes properties like `bind`, `call`, `apply`, and others present on all function values in JavaScript.
It also has the special property that values of type `Function` can always be called; these calls return `any`:

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(f: Function) {
  return f(1, 2, 3);
}
```

This is an _untyped function call_ and is generally best avoided because of the unsafe `any` return type.

If you need to accept an arbitrary function but don't intend to call it, the type `() => void` is generally safer.

### Rest Parameters

In addition to using optional parameters or overloads to make functions that can accept a variety of fixed argument counts, we can also define functions that take an _unbounded_ number of arguments using _rest parameters_.

A rest parameter appears after all other parameters, and uses the `...` syntax:

```ts twoslash
function multiply(n: number, ...m: number[]) {
  return m.map((x) => n * x);
}
// 'a' gets value [10, 20, 30, 40]
const a = multiply(10, 1, 2, 3, 4);
```

In TypeScript, the type annotation on these parameters is implicitly `any[]` instead of `any`, and any type annotation given must be of the form `Array<T>` or `T[]`, or a tuple type (which we'll learn about later).

### Rest Arguments

Conversely, we can _provide_ a variable number of arguments from an iterable object (for example, an array) using the spread syntax.
For example, the `push` method of arrays takes any number of arguments:

```ts twoslash
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
arr1.push(...arr2);
```

Note that in general, TypeScript does not assume that arrays are immutable.
This can lead to some surprising behavior:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2556
// Inferred type is number[] -- "an array with zero or more numbers",
// not specifically two numbers
const args = [8, 5];
const angle = Math.atan2(...args);
```

The best fix for this situation depends a bit on your code, but in general a `const` context is the most straightforward solution:

```ts twoslash
// Inferred as 2-length tuple
const args = [8, 5] as const;
// OK
const angle = Math.atan2(...args);
```

Using rest arguments may require turning on [`downlevelIteration`](/tsconfig#downlevelIteration) when targeting older runtimes.

## Parameter Destructuring

   </p>

You can use parameter destructuring to conveniently unpack objects provided as an argument into one or more local variables in the function body.
In JavaScript, it looks like this:

```js
function sum({ a, b, c }) {
  console.log(a + b + c);
}
sum({ a: 10, b: 3, c: 9 });
```

The type annotation for the object goes after the destructuring syntax:

```ts twoslash
function sum({ a, b, c }: { a: number; b: number; c: number }) {
  console.log(a + b + c);
}
```

This can look a bit verbose, but you can use a named type here as well:

```ts twoslash
// Same as prior example
type ABC = { a: number; b: number; c: number };
function sum({ a, b, c }: ABC) {
  console.log(a + b + c);
}
```

## Assignability of Functions

### Return type `void`

The `void` return type for functions can produce some unusual, but expected behavior.

Contextual typing with a return type of `void` does **not** force functions to **not** return something. Another way to say this is a contextual function type with a `void` return type (`type voidFunc = () => void`), when implemented, can return _any_ other value, but it will be ignored.

Thus, the following implementations of the type `() => void` are valid:

```ts twoslash
type voidFunc = () => void;

const f1: voidFunc = () => {
  return true;
};

const f2: voidFunc = () => true;

const f3: voidFunc = function () {
  return true;
};
```

And when the return value of one of these functions is assigned to another variable, it will retain the type of `void`:

```ts twoslash
type voidFunc = () => void;

const f1: voidFunc = () => {
  return true;
};

const f2: voidFunc = () => true;

const f3: voidFunc = function () {
  return true;
};
// ---cut---
const v1 = f1();

const v2 = f2();

const v3 = f3();
```

This behavior exists so that the following code is valid even though `Array.prototype.push` returns a number and the `Array.prototype.forEach` method expects a function with a return type of `void`.

```ts twoslash
const src = [1, 2, 3];
const dst = [0];

src.forEach((el) => dst.push(el));
```

There is one other special case to be aware of, when a literal function definition has a `void` return type, that function must **not** return anything.

```ts twoslash
function f2(): void {
  // @ts-expect-error
  return true;
}

const f3 = function (): void {
  // @ts-expect-error
  return true;
};
```

oneline: "How TypeScript describes the shapes of JavaScript objects."
---

In JavaScript, the fundamental way that we group and pass around data is through objects.
In TypeScript, we represent those through _object types_.

As we've seen, they can be anonymous:

```ts twoslash
function greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {
  //                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

or they can be named by using either an interface:

```ts twoslash
interface Person {
  //      ^^^^^^
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function greet(person: Person) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

or a type alias:

```ts twoslash
type Person = {
  // ^^^^^^
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function greet(person: Person) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

In all three examples above, we've written functions that take objects that contain the property `name` (which must be a `string`) and `age` (which must be a `number`).

## Quick Reference

We have cheat-sheets available for both [`type` and `interface`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets), if you want a quick look at the important every-day syntax at a glance.

## Property Modifiers

Each property in an object type can specify a couple of things: the type, whether the property is optional, and whether the property can be written to.

### Optional Properties

Much of the time, we'll find ourselves dealing with objects that _might_ have a property set.
In those cases, we can mark those properties as _optional_ by adding a question mark (`?`) to the end of their names.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {}
declare function getShape(): Shape;

// ---cut---
interface PaintOptions {
  shape: Shape;
  xPos?: number;
  //  ^
  yPos?: number;
  //  ^
}

function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {
  // ...
}

const shape = getShape();
paintShape({ shape });
paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100 });
paintShape({ shape, yPos: 100 });
paintShape({ shape, xPos: 100, yPos: 100 });
```

In this example, both `xPos` and `yPos` are considered optional.
We can choose to provide either of them, so every call above to `paintShape` is valid.
All optionality really says is that if the property _is_ set, it better have a specific type.

We can also read from those properties - but when we do under [`strictNullChecks`](/tsconfig#strictNullChecks), TypeScript will tell us they're potentially `undefined`.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {}
declare function getShape(): Shape;

interface PaintOptions {
  shape: Shape;
  xPos?: number;
  yPos?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {
  let xPos = opts.xPos;
  //              ^?
  let yPos = opts.yPos;
  //              ^?
  // ...
}
```

In JavaScript, even if the property has never been set, we can still access it - it's just going to give us the value `undefined`.
We can just handle `undefined` specially by checking for it.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {}
declare function getShape(): Shape;

interface PaintOptions {
  shape: Shape;
  xPos?: number;
  yPos?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function paintShape(opts: PaintOptions) {
  let xPos = opts.xPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.xPos;
  //  ^?
  let yPos = opts.yPos === undefined ? 0 : opts.yPos;
  //  ^?
  // ...
}
```

Note that this pattern of setting defaults for unspecified values is so common that JavaScript has syntax to support it.

```ts twoslash
interface Shape {}
declare function getShape(): Shape;

interface PaintOptions {
  shape: Shape;
  xPos?: number;
  yPos?: number;
}

// ---cut---
function paintShape({ shape, xPos = 0, yPos = 0 }: PaintOptions) {
  console.log("x coordinate at", xPos);
  //                             ^?
  console.log("y coordinate at", yPos);
  //                             ^?
  // ...
}
```

Here we used [a destructuring pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) for `paintShape`'s parameter, and provided [default values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Default_values) for `xPos` and `yPos`.
Now `xPos` and `yPos` are both definitely present within the body of `paintShape`, but optional for any callers to `paintShape`.

> Note that there is currently no way to place type annotations within destructuring patterns.
> This is because the following syntax already means something different in JavaScript.
>
> ```ts twoslash
> // @noImplicitAny: false
> // @errors: 2552 2304
> interface Shape {}
> declare function render(x: unknown);
> // ---cut---
> function draw({ shape: Shape, xPos: number = 100 /*...*/ }) {
>   render(shape);
>   render(xPos);
> }
> ```
>
> In an object destructuring pattern, `shape: Shape` means "grab the property `shape` and redefine it locally as a variable named `Shape`."
> Likewise `xPos: number` creates a variable named `number` whose value is based on the parameter's `xPos`.

### `readonly` Properties

Properties can also be marked as `readonly` for TypeScript.
While it won't change any behavior at runtime, a property marked as `readonly` can't be written to during type-checking.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2540
interface SomeType {
  readonly prop: string;
}

function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {
  // We can read from 'obj.prop'.
  console.log(`prop has the value '${obj.prop}'.`);

  // But we can't re-assign it.
  obj.prop = "hello";
}
```

Using the `readonly` modifier doesn't necessarily imply that a value is totally immutable - or in other words, that its internal contents can't be changed.
It just means the property itself can't be re-written to.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2540
interface Home {
  readonly resident: { name: string; age: number };
}

function visitForBirthday(home: Home) {
  // We can read and update properties from 'home.resident'.
  console.log(`Happy birthday ${home.resident.name}!`);
  home.resident.age++;
}

function evict(home: Home) {
  // But we can't write to the 'resident' property itself on a 'Home'.
  home.resident = {
    name: "Victor the Evictor",
    age: 42,
  };
}
```

It's important to manage expectations of what `readonly` implies.
It's useful to signal intent during development time for TypeScript on how an object should be used.
TypeScript doesn't factor in whether properties on two types are `readonly` when checking whether those types are compatible, so `readonly` properties can also change via aliasing.

```ts twoslash
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface ReadonlyPerson {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly age: number;
}

let writablePerson: Person = {
  name: "Person McPersonface",
  age: 42,
};

// works
let readonlyPerson: ReadonlyPerson = writablePerson;

console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints '42'
writablePerson.age++;
console.log(readonlyPerson.age); // prints '43'
```

Using [mapping modifiers](/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#mapping-modifiers), you can remove `readonly` attributes.

### Index Signatures

Sometimes you don't know all the names of a type's properties ahead of time, but you do know the shape of the values.

In those cases you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values, for example:

```ts twoslash
declare function getStringArray(): StringArray;
// ---cut---
interface StringArray {
  [index: number]: string;
}

const myArray: StringArray = getStringArray();
const secondItem = myArray[1];
//     ^?
```

Above, we have a `StringArray` interface which has an index signature.
This index signature states that when a `StringArray` is indexed with a `number`, it will return a `string`.

Only some types are allowed for index signature properties: `string`, `number`, `symbol`, template string patterns, and union types consisting only of these.

<details>
    <summary>It is possible to support multiple types of indexers...</summary>
    <p>It is possible to support multiple types of indexers. Note that when using both `number` and `string` indexers, the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer. This is because when indexing with a <code>number</code>, JavaScript will actually convert that to a <code>string</code> before indexing into an object. That means that indexing with <code>100</code> (a <code>number</code>) is the same thing as indexing with <code>"100"</code> (a <code>string</code>), so the two need to be consistent.</p>

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2413
// @strictPropertyInitialization: false
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

// Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!
interface NotOkay {
  [x: number]: Animal;
  [x: string]: Dog;
}
```

</details>

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the "dictionary" pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type.
This is because a string index declares that `obj.property` is also available as `obj["property"]`.
In the following example, `name`'s type does not match the string index's type, and the type checker gives an error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2411
// @errors: 2411
interface NumberDictionary {
  [index: string]: number;

  length: number; // ok
  name: string;
}
```

However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:

```ts twoslash
interface NumberOrStringDictionary {
  [index: string]: number | string;
  length: number; // ok, length is a number
  name: string; // ok, name is a string
}
```

Finally, you can make index signatures `readonly` in order to prevent assignment to their indices:

```ts twoslash
declare function getReadOnlyStringArray(): ReadonlyStringArray;
// ---cut---
// @errors: 2542
interface ReadonlyStringArray {
  readonly [index: number]: string;
}

let myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = getReadOnlyStringArray();
myArray[2] = "Mallory";
```

You can't set `myArray[2]` because the index signature is `readonly`.

## Excess Property Checks

Where and how an object is assigned a type can make a difference in the type system.
One of the key examples of this is in excess property checking, which validates the object more thoroughly when it is created and assigned to an object type during creation.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345 2739
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}

let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });
```

Notice the given argument to `createSquare` is spelled _`colour`_ instead of `color`.
In plain JavaScript, this sort of thing fails silently.

You could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the `width` properties are compatible, there's no `color` property present, and the extra `colour` property is insignificant.

However, TypeScript takes the stance that there's probably a bug in this code.
Object literals get special treatment and undergo _excess property checking_ when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments.
If an object literal has any properties that the "target type" doesn't have, you'll get an error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345 2739
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}
// ---cut---
let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });
```

Getting around these checks is actually really simple.
The easiest method is to just use a type assertion:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345 2739
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}
// ---cut---
let mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);
```

However, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you're sure that the object can have some extra properties that are used in some special way.
If `SquareConfig` can have `color` and `width` properties with the above types, but could _also_ have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:

```ts twoslash
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
  [propName: string]: unknown;
}
```

Here we're saying that `SquareConfig` can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren't `color` or `width`, their types don't matter.

One final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable:
Since assigning `squareOptions` won't undergo excess property checks, the compiler won't give you an error:

```ts twoslash
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}
// ---cut---
let squareOptions = { colour: "red", width: 100 };
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
```

The above workaround will work as long as you have a common property between `squareOptions` and `SquareConfig`.
In this example, it was the property `width`. It will however, fail if the variable does not have any common object property. For example:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2559
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}
// ---cut---
let squareOptions = { colour: "red" };
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
```

Keep in mind that for simple code like above, you probably shouldn't be trying to "get around" these checks.
For more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.

That means if you're running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to revise some of your type declarations.
In this instance, if it's okay to pass an object with both a `color` or `colour` property to `createSquare`, you should fix up the definition of `SquareConfig` to reflect that.

## Extending Types

It's pretty common to have types that might be more specific versions of other types.
For example, we might have a `BasicAddress` type that describes the fields necessary for sending letters and packages in the U.S.

```ts twoslash
interface BasicAddress {
  name?: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}
```

In some situations that's enough, but addresses often have a unit number associated with them if the building at an address has multiple units.
We can then describe an `AddressWithUnit`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts twoslash
interface AddressWithUnit {
  name?: string;
  unit: string;
//^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}
```

This does the job, but the downside here is that we had to repeat all the other fields from `BasicAddress` when our changes were purely additive.
Instead, we can extend the original `BasicAddress` type and just add the new fields that are unique to `AddressWithUnit`.

```ts twoslash
interface BasicAddress {
  name?: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}

interface AddressWithUnit extends BasicAddress {
  unit: string;
}
```

The `extends` keyword on an `interface` allows us to effectively copy members from other named types, and add whatever new members we want.
This can be useful for cutting down the amount of type declaration boilerplate we have to write, and for signaling intent that several different declarations of the same property might be related.
For example, `AddressWithUnit` didn't need to repeat the `street` property, and because `street` originates from `BasicAddress`, a reader will know that those two types are related in some way.

`interface`s can also extend from multiple types.

```ts twoslash
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}

interface ColorfulCircle extends Colorful, Circle {}

const cc: ColorfulCircle = {
  color: "red",
  radius: 42,
};
```

## Intersection Types

`interface`s allowed us to build up new types from other types by extending them.
TypeScript provides another construct called _intersection types_ that is mainly used to combine existing object types.

An intersection type is defined using the `&` operator.

```ts twoslash
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}
interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}

type ColorfulCircle = Colorful & Circle;
```

Here, we've intersected `Colorful` and `Circle` to produce a new type that has all the members of `Colorful` _and_ `Circle`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}
interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}
// ---cut---
function draw(circle: Colorful & Circle) {
  console.log(`Color was ${circle.color}`);
  console.log(`Radius was ${circle.radius}`);
}

// okay
draw({ color: "blue", radius: 42 });

// oops
draw({ color: "red", raidus: 42 });
```

## Interface Extension vs. Intersection

We just looked at two ways to combine types which are similar, but are actually subtly different.
With interfaces, we could use an `extends` clause to extend from other types, and we were able to do something similar with intersections and name the result with a type alias.
The principal difference between the two is how conflicts are handled, and that difference is typically one of the main reasons why you'd pick one over the other between an interface and a type alias of an intersection type.

If interfaces are defined with the same name, TypeScript will attempt to merge them if the properties are compatible. If the properties are not compatible (i.e., they have the same property name but different types), TypeScript will raise an error.

In the case of intersection types, properties with different types will be merged automatically. When the type is used later, TypeScript will expect the property to satisfy both types simultaneously, which may produce unexpected results.

For example, the following code will throw an error because the properties are incompatible:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  name: number;
}
```

In contrast, the following code will compile, but it results in a `never` type:

```ts twoslash
interface Person1 {
  name: string;
}

interface Person2 {
  name: number;
}

type Staff = Person1 & Person2

declare const staffer: Staff;
staffer.name;
//       ^?
```
In this case, Staff would require the name property to be both a string and a number, which results in property being of type `never`.

## Generic Object Types

Let's imagine a `Box` type that can contain any value - `string`s, `number`s, `Giraffe`s, whatever.

```ts twoslash
interface Box {
  contents: any;
}
```

Right now, the `contents` property is typed as `any`, which works, but can lead to accidents down the line.

We could instead use `unknown`, but that would mean that in cases where we already know the type of `contents`, we'd need to do precautionary checks, or use error-prone type assertions.

```ts twoslash
interface Box {
  contents: unknown;
}

let x: Box = {
  contents: "hello world",
};

// we could check 'x.contents'
if (typeof x.contents === "string") {
  console.log(x.contents.toLowerCase());
}

// or we could use a type assertion
console.log((x.contents as string).toLowerCase());
```

One type safe approach would be to instead scaffold out different `Box` types for every type of `contents`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
interface NumberBox {
  contents: number;
}

interface StringBox {
  contents: string;
}

interface BooleanBox {
  contents: boolean;
}
```

But that means we'll have to create different functions, or overloads of functions, to operate on these types.

```ts twoslash
interface NumberBox {
  contents: number;
}

interface StringBox {
  contents: string;
}

interface BooleanBox {
  contents: boolean;
}
// ---cut---
function setContents(box: StringBox, newContents: string): void;
function setContents(box: NumberBox, newContents: number): void;
function setContents(box: BooleanBox, newContents: boolean): void;
function setContents(box: { contents: any }, newContents: any) {
  box.contents = newContents;
}
```

That's a lot of boilerplate. Moreover, we might later need to introduce new types and overloads.
This is frustrating, since our box types and overloads are all effectively the same.

Instead, we can make a _generic_ `Box` type which declares a _type parameter_.

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
```

You might read this as “A `Box` of `Type` is something whose `contents` have type `Type`”.
Later on, when we refer to `Box`, we have to give a _type argument_ in place of `Type`.

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
// ---cut---
let box: Box<string>;
```

Think of `Box` as a template for a real type, where `Type` is a placeholder that will get replaced with some other type.
When TypeScript sees `Box<string>`, it will replace every instance of `Type` in `Box<Type>` with `string`, and end up working with something like `{ contents: string }`.
In other words, `Box<string>` and our earlier `StringBox` work identically.

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
interface StringBox {
  contents: string;
}

let boxA: Box<string> = { contents: "hello" };
boxA.contents;
//   ^?

let boxB: StringBox = { contents: "world" };
boxB.contents;
//   ^?
```

`Box` is reusable in that `Type` can be substituted with anything. That means that when we need a box for a new type, we don't need to declare a new `Box` type at all (though we certainly could if we wanted to).

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}

interface Apple {
  // ....
}

// Same as '{ contents: Apple }'.
type AppleBox = Box<Apple>;
```

This also means that we can avoid overloads entirely by instead using [generic functions](/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#generic-functions).

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}

// ---cut---
function setContents<Type>(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type) {
  box.contents = newContents;
}
```

It is worth noting that type aliases can also be generic. We could have defined our new `Box<Type>` interface, which was:

```ts twoslash
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
```

by using a type alias instead:

```ts twoslash
type Box<Type> = {
  contents: Type;
};
```

Since type aliases, unlike interfaces, can describe more than just object types, we can also use them to write other kinds of generic helper types.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2575
type OrNull<Type> = Type | null;

type OneOrMany<Type> = Type | Type[];

type OneOrManyOrNull<Type> = OrNull<OneOrMany<Type>>;
//   ^?

type OneOrManyOrNullStrings = OneOrManyOrNull<string>;
//   ^?
```

We'll circle back to type aliases in just a little bit.

### The `Array` Type

Generic object types are often some sort of container type that work independently of the type of elements they contain.
It's ideal for data structures to work this way so that they're re-usable across different data types.

It turns out we've been working with a type just like that throughout this handbook: the `Array` type.
Whenever we write out types like `number[]` or `string[]`, that's really just a shorthand for `Array<number>` and `Array<string>`.

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(value: Array<string>) {
  // ...
}

let myArray: string[] = ["hello", "world"];

// either of these work!
doSomething(myArray);
doSomething(new Array("hello", "world"));
```

Much like the `Box` type above, `Array` itself is a generic type.

```ts twoslash
// @noLib: true
interface Number {}
interface String {}
interface Boolean {}
interface Symbol {}
// ---cut---
interface Array<Type> {
  /**
   * Gets or sets the length of the array.
   */
  length: number;

  /**
   * Removes the last element from an array and returns it.
   */
  pop(): Type | undefined;

  /**
   * Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.
   */
  push(...items: Type[]): number;

  // ...
}
```

Modern JavaScript also provides other data structures which are generic, like `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, and `Promise<T>`.
All this really means is that because of how `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise` behave, they can work with any sets of types.

### The `ReadonlyArray` Type

The `ReadonlyArray` is a special type that describes arrays that shouldn't be changed.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function doStuff(values: ReadonlyArray<string>) {
  // We can read from 'values'...
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  values.push("hello!");
}
```

Much like the `readonly` modifier for properties, it's mainly a tool we can use for intent.
When we see a function that returns `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us we're not meant to change the contents at all, and when we see a function that consumes `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us that we can pass any array into that function without worrying that it will change its contents.

Unlike `Array`, there isn't a `ReadonlyArray` constructor that we can use.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2693
new ReadonlyArray("red", "green", "blue");
```

Instead, we can assign regular `Array`s to `ReadonlyArray`s.

```ts twoslash
const roArray: ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array<Type>` with `Type[]`, it also provides a shorthand syntax for `ReadonlyArray<Type>` with `readonly Type[]`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function doStuff(values: readonly string[]) {
  //                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  // We can read from 'values'...
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  values.push("hello!");
}
```

One last thing to note is that unlike the `readonly` property modifier, assignability isn't bidirectional between regular `Array`s and `ReadonlyArray`s.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 4104
let x: readonly string[] = [];
let y: string[] = [];

x = y;
y = x;
```

### Tuple Types

A _tuple type_ is another sort of `Array` type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.

```ts twoslash
type StringNumberPair = [string, number];
//                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Here, `StringNumberPair` is a tuple type of `string` and `number`.
Like `ReadonlyArray`, it has no representation at runtime, but is significant to TypeScript.
To the type system, `StringNumberPair` describes arrays whose `0` index contains a `string` and whose `1` index contains a `number`.

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {
  const a = pair[0];
  //    ^?
  const b = pair[1];
  //    ^?
  // ...
}

doSomething(["hello", 42]);
```

If we try to index past the number of elements, we'll get an error.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2493
function doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {
  // ...

  const c = pair[2];
}
```

We can also [destructure tuples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring) using JavaScript's array destructuring.

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(stringHash: [string, number]) {
  const [inputString, hash] = stringHash;

  console.log(inputString);
  //          ^?

  console.log(hash);
  //          ^?
}
```

> Tuple types are useful in heavily convention-based APIs, where each element's meaning is "obvious".
> This gives us flexibility in whatever we want to name our variables when we destructure them.
> In the above example, we were able to name elements `0` and `1` to whatever we wanted.
>
> However, since not every user holds the same view of what's obvious, it may be worth reconsidering whether using objects with descriptive property names may be better for your API.

Other than those length checks, simple tuple types like these are equivalent to types which are versions of `Array`s that declare properties for specific indexes, and that declare `length` with a numeric literal type.

```ts twoslash
interface StringNumberPair {
  // specialized properties
  length: 2;
  0: string;
  1: number;

  // Other 'Array<string | number>' members...
  slice(start?: number, end?: number): Array<string | number>;
}
```

Another thing you may be interested in is that tuples can have optional properties by writing out a question mark (`?` after an element's type).
Optional tuple elements can only come at the end, and also affect the type of `length`.

```ts twoslash
type Either2dOr3d = [number, number, number?];

function setCoordinate(coord: Either2dOr3d) {
  const [x, y, z] = coord;
  //           ^?

  console.log(`Provided coordinates had ${coord.length} dimensions`);
  //                                            ^?
}
```

Tuples can also have rest elements, which have to be an array/tuple type.

```ts twoslash
type StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];
type StringBooleansNumber = [string, ...boolean[], number];
type BooleansStringNumber = [...boolean[], string, number];
```

- `StringNumberBooleans` describes a tuple whose first two elements are `string` and `number` respectively, but which may have any number of `boolean`s following.
- `StringBooleansNumber` describes a tuple whose first element is `string` and then any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `number`.
- `BooleansStringNumber` describes a tuple whose starting elements are any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `string` then a `number`.

A tuple with a rest element has no set "length" - it only has a set of well-known elements in different positions.

```ts twoslash
type StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];
// ---cut---
const a: StringNumberBooleans = ["hello", 1];
const b: StringNumberBooleans = ["beautiful", 2, true];
const c: StringNumberBooleans = ["world", 3, true, false, true, false, true];
```

Why might optional and rest elements be useful?
Well, it allows TypeScript to correspond tuples with parameter lists.
Tuples types can be used in [rest parameters and arguments](/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#rest-parameters-and-arguments), so that the following:

```ts twoslash
function readButtonInput(...args: [string, number, ...boolean[]]) {
  const [name, version, ...input] = args;
  // ...
}
```

is basically equivalent to:

```ts twoslash
function readButtonInput(name: string, version: number, ...input: boolean[]) {
  // ...
}
```

This is handy when you want to take a variable number of arguments with a rest parameter, and you need a minimum number of elements, but you don't want to introduce intermediate variables.

<!--
TODO do we need this example?

For example, imagine we need to write a function that adds up `number`s based on arguments that get passed in.

```ts twoslash
function sum(...args: number[]) {
    // ...
}
```

We might feel like it makes little sense to take any fewer than 2 elements, so we want to require callers to provide at least 2 arguments.
A first attempt might be

```ts twoslash
function foo(a: number, b: number, ...args: number[]) {
    args.unshift(a, b);

    let result = 0;
    for (const value of args) {
        result += value;
    }
    return result;
}
```

-->

### `readonly` Tuple Types

One final note about tuple types - tuple types have `readonly` variants, and can be specified by sticking a `readonly` modifier in front of them - just like with array shorthand syntax.

```ts twoslash
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {
  //                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  // ...
}
```

As you might expect, writing to any property of a `readonly` tuple isn't allowed in TypeScript.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2540
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {
  pair[0] = "hello!";
}
```

Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly` tuples when possible is a good default.
This is also important given that array literals with `const` assertions will be inferred with `readonly` tuple types.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
let point = [3, 4] as const;

function distanceFromOrigin([x, y]: [number, number]) {
  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
}

distanceFromOrigin(point);
```

Here, `distanceFromOrigin` never modifies its elements, but expects a mutable tuple.
Since `point`'s type was inferred as `readonly [3, 4]`, it won't be compatible with `[number, number]` since that type can't guarantee `point`'s elements won't be mutated.

---

A major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable.
Components that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.

In languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is _generics_, that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.
This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

## Hello World of Generics

To start off, let's do the "hello world" of generics: the identity function.
The identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in.
You can think of this in a similar way to the `echo` command.

Without generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:

```ts twoslash
function identity(arg: number): number {
  return arg;
}
```

Or, we could describe the identity function using the `any` type:

```ts twoslash
function identity(arg: any): any {
  return arg;
}
```

While using `any` is certainly generic in that it will cause the function to accept any and all types for the type of `arg`, we actually are losing the information about what that type was when the function returns.
If we passed in a number, the only information we have is that any type could be returned.

Instead, we need a way of capturing the type of the argument in such a way that we can also use it to denote what is being returned.
Here, we will use a _type variable_, a special kind of variable that works on types rather than values.

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

We've now added a type variable `Type` to the identity function.
This `Type` allows us to capture the type the user provides (e.g. `number`), so that we can use that information later.
Here, we use `Type` again as the return type. On inspection, we can now see the same type is used for the argument and the return type.
This allows us to traffic that type information in one side of the function and out the other.

We say that this version of the `identity` function is generic, as it works over a range of types.
Unlike using `any`, it's also just as precise (i.e., it doesn't lose any information) as the first `identity` function that used numbers for the argument and return type.

Once we've written the generic identity function, we can call it in one of two ways.
The first way is to pass all of the arguments, including the type argument, to the function:

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
// ---cut---
let output = identity<string>("myString");
//       ^?
```

Here we explicitly set `Type` to be `string` as one of the arguments to the function call, denoted using the `<>` around the arguments rather than `()`.

The second way is also perhaps the most common. Here we use _type argument inference_ -- that is, we want the compiler to set the value of `Type` for us automatically based on the type of the argument we pass in:

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
// ---cut---
let output = identity("myString");
//       ^?
```

Notice that we didn't have to explicitly pass the type in the angle brackets (`<>`); the compiler just looked at the value `"myString"`, and set `Type` to its type.
While type argument inference can be a helpful tool to keep code shorter and more readable, you may need to explicitly pass in the type arguments as we did in the previous example when the compiler fails to infer the type, as may happen in more complex examples.

## Working with Generic Type Variables

When you begin to use generics, you'll notice that when you create generic functions like `identity`, the compiler will enforce that you use any generically typed parameters in the body of the function correctly.
That is, that you actually treat these parameters as if they could be any and all types.

Let's take our `identity` function from earlier:

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
```

What if we want to also log the length of the argument `arg` to the console with each call?
We might be tempted to write this:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function loggingIdentity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
```

When we do, the compiler will give us an error that we're using the `.length` member of `arg`, but nowhere have we said that `arg` has this member.
Remember, we said earlier that these type variables stand in for any and all types, so someone using this function could have passed in a `number` instead, which does not have a `.length` member.

Let's say that we've actually intended this function to work on arrays of `Type` rather than `Type` directly. Since we're working with arrays, the `.length` member should be available.
We can describe this just like we would create arrays of other types:

```ts twoslash {1}
function loggingIdentity<Type>(arg: Type[]): Type[] {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
```

You can read the type of `loggingIdentity` as "the generic function `loggingIdentity` takes a type parameter `Type`, and an argument `arg` which is an array of `Type`s, and returns an array of `Type`s."
If we passed in an array of numbers, we'd get an array of numbers back out, as `Type` would bind to `number`.
This allows us to use our generic type variable `Type` as part of the types we're working with, rather than the whole type, giving us greater flexibility.

We can alternatively write the sample example this way:

```ts twoslash {1}
function loggingIdentity<Type>(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type> {
  console.log(arg.length); // Array has a .length, so no more error
  return arg;
}
```

You may already be familiar with this style of type from other languages.
In the next section, we'll cover how you can create your own generic types like `Array<Type>`.

## Generic Types

In previous sections, we created generic identity functions that worked over a range of types.
In this section, we'll explore the type of the functions themselves and how to create generic interfaces.

The type of generic functions is just like those of non-generic functions, with the type parameters listed first, similarly to function declarations:

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: <Type>(arg: Type) => Type = identity;
```

We could also have used a different name for the generic type parameter in the type, so long as the number of type variables and how the type variables are used line up.

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: <Input>(arg: Input) => Input = identity;
```

We can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type:

```ts twoslash
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: { <Type>(arg: Type): Type } = identity;
```

Which leads us to writing our first generic interface.
Let's take the object literal from the previous example and move it to an interface:

```ts twoslash
interface GenericIdentityFn {
  <Type>(arg: Type): Type;
}

function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn = identity;
```

In a similar example, we may want to move the generic parameter to be a parameter of the whole interface.
This lets us see what type(s) we're generic over (e.g. `Dictionary<string>` rather than just `Dictionary`).
This makes the type parameter visible to all the other members of the interface.

```ts twoslash
interface GenericIdentityFn<Type> {
  (arg: Type): Type;
}

function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn<number> = identity;
```

Notice that our example has changed to be something slightly different.
Instead of describing a generic function, we now have a non-generic function signature that is a part of a generic type.
When we use `GenericIdentityFn`, we now will also need to specify the corresponding type argument (here: `number`), effectively locking in what the underlying call signature will use.
Understanding when to put the type parameter directly on the call signature and when to put it on the interface itself will be helpful in describing what aspects of a type are generic.

In addition to generic interfaces, we can also create generic classes.
Note that it is not possible to create generic enums and namespaces.

## Generic Classes

A generic class has a similar shape to a generic interface.
Generic classes have a generic type parameter list in angle brackets (`<>`) following the name of the class.

```ts twoslash
// @strict: false
class GenericNumber<NumType> {
  zeroValue: NumType;
  add: (x: NumType, y: NumType) => NumType;
}

let myGenericNumber = new GenericNumber<number>();
myGenericNumber.zeroValue = 0;
myGenericNumber.add = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
```

This is a pretty literal use of the `GenericNumber` class, but you may have noticed that nothing is restricting it to only use the `number` type.
We could have instead used `string` or even more complex objects.

```ts twoslash
// @strict: false
class GenericNumber<NumType> {
  zeroValue: NumType;
  add: (x: NumType, y: NumType) => NumType;
}
// ---cut---
let stringNumeric = new GenericNumber<string>();
stringNumeric.zeroValue = "";
stringNumeric.add = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(stringNumeric.add(stringNumeric.zeroValue, "test"));
```

Just as with interface, putting the type parameter on the class itself lets us make sure all of the properties of the class are working with the same type.

As we cover in [our section on classes](/docs/handbook/2/classes.html), a class has two sides to its type: the static side and the instance side.
Generic classes are only generic over their instance side rather than their static side, so when working with classes, static members can not use the class's type parameter.

## Generic Constraints

If you remember from an earlier example, you may sometimes want to write a generic function that works on a set of types where you have _some_ knowledge about what capabilities that set of types will have.
In our `loggingIdentity` example, we wanted to be able to access the `.length` property of `arg`, but the compiler could not prove that every type had a `.length` property, so it warns us that we can't make this assumption.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
function loggingIdentity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
```

Instead of working with any and all types, we'd like to constrain this function to work with any and all types that *also*  have the `.length` property.
As long as the type has this member, we'll allow it, but it's required to have at least this member.
To do so, we must list our requirement as a constraint on what `Type` can be.

To do so, we'll create an interface that describes our constraint.
Here, we'll create an interface that has a single `.length` property and then we'll use this interface and the `extends` keyword to denote our constraint:

```ts twoslash
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function loggingIdentity<Type extends Lengthwise>(arg: Type): Type {
  console.log(arg.length); // Now we know it has a .length property, so no more error
  return arg;
}
```

Because the generic function is now constrained, it will no longer work over any and all types:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function loggingIdentity<Type extends Lengthwise>(arg: Type): Type {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
// ---cut---
loggingIdentity(3);
```

Instead, we need to pass in values whose type has all the required properties:

```ts twoslash
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function loggingIdentity<Type extends Lengthwise>(arg: Type): Type {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}
// ---cut---
loggingIdentity({ length: 10, value: 3 });
```

## Using Type Parameters in Generic Constraints

You can declare a type parameter that is constrained by another type parameter.
For example, here we'd like to get a property from an object given its name.
We'd like to ensure that we're not accidentally grabbing a property that does not exist on the `obj`, so we'll place a constraint between the two types:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
function getProperty<Type, Key extends keyof Type>(obj: Type, key: Key) {
  return obj[key];
}

let x = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };

getProperty(x, "a");
getProperty(x, "m");
```

## Using Class Types in Generics

When creating factories in TypeScript using generics, it is necessary to refer to class types by their constructor functions. For example,

```ts twoslash
function create<Type>(c: { new (): Type }): Type {
  return new c();
}
```

A more advanced example uses the prototype property to infer and constrain relationships between the constructor function and the instance side of class types.

```ts twoslash
// @strict: false
class BeeKeeper {
  hasMask: boolean = true;
}

class ZooKeeper {
  nametag: string = "Mikle";
}

class Animal {
  numLegs: number = 4;
}

class Bee extends Animal {
  numLegs = 6;
  keeper: BeeKeeper = new BeeKeeper();
}

class Lion extends Animal {
  keeper: ZooKeeper = new ZooKeeper();
}

function createInstance<A extends Animal>(c: new () => A): A {
  return new c();
}

createInstance(Lion).keeper.nametag;
createInstance(Bee).keeper.hasMask;
```

This pattern is used to power the [mixins](/docs/handbook/mixins.html) design pattern.

## Generic Parameter Defaults

By declaring a default for a generic type parameter, you make it optional to specify the corresponding type argument. For example, a function which creates a new `HTMLElement`. Calling the function with no arguments generates a `HTMLDivElement`; calling the function with an element as the first argument generates an element of the argument's type. You can optionally pass a list of children as well. Previously you would have to define the function as:


```ts twoslash
type Container<T, U> = {
  element: T;
  children: U;
};

// ---cut---
declare function create(): Container<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement[]>;
declare function create<T extends HTMLElement>(element: T): Container<T, T[]>;
declare function create<T extends HTMLElement, U extends HTMLElement>(
  element: T,
  children: U[]
): Container<T, U[]>;
```

With generic parameter defaults we can reduce it to:

```ts twoslash
type Container<T, U> = {
  element: T;
  children: U;
};

// ---cut---
declare function create<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLDivElement, U extends HTMLElement[] = T[]>(
  element?: T,
  children?: U
): Container<T, U>;

const div = create();
//    ^?

const p = create(new HTMLParagraphElement());
//    ^?
```

A generic parameter default follows the following rules:

- A type parameter is deemed optional if it has a default.
- Required type parameters must not follow optional type parameters.
- Default types for a type parameter must satisfy the constraint for the type parameter, if it exists.
- When specifying type arguments, you are only required to specify type arguments for the required type parameters. Unspecified type parameters will resolve to their default types.
- If a default type is specified and inference cannot choose a candidate, the default type is inferred.
- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a default for an existing type parameter.
- A class or interface declaration that merges with an existing class or interface declaration may introduce a new type parameter as long as it specifies a default.

## Variance Annotations

> This is an advanced feature for solving a very specific problem, and should only be used in situations where you've identified a reason to use it

[Covariance and contravariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)) are type theory terms that describe what the relationship between two generic types is.
Here's a brief primer on the concept.

For example, if you have an interface representing an object that can `make` a certain type:
```ts
interface Producer<T> {
  make(): T;
}
```
We can use a `Producer<Cat>` where a `Producer<Animal>` is expected, because a `Cat` is an `Animal`.
This relationship is called *covariance*: the relationship from `Producer<T>` to `Producer<U>` is the same as the relationship from `T` to `U`.

Conversely, if you have an interface that can `consume` a certain type:
```ts
interface Consumer<T> {
  consume: (arg: T) => void;
}
```
Then we can use a `Consumer<Animal>` where a `Consumer<Cat>` is expected, because any function that is capable of accepting an `Animal` must also be capable of accepting a `Cat`.
This relationship is called *contravariance*: the relationship from `Consumer<T>` to `Consumer<U>` is the same as the relationship from `U` to `T`.
Note the reversal of direction as compared to covariance! This is why contravariance "cancels itself out" but covariance doesn't.

In a structural type system like TypeScript's, covariance and contravariance are naturally emergent behaviors that follow from the definition of types.
Even in the absence of generics, we would see covariant (and contravariant) relationships:
```ts
interface AnimalProducer {
  make(): Animal;
}

// A CatProducer can be used anywhere an
// Animal producer is expected
interface CatProducer {
  make(): Cat;

TypeScript has a structural type system, so when comparing two types, e.g. to see if a `Producer<Cat>` can be used where a `Producer<Animal>` is expected, the usual algorithm would be structurally expand both of those definitions, and compare their structures.
However, variance allows for an extremely useful optimization: if `Producer<T>` is covariant on `T`, then we can simply check `Cat` and `Animal` instead, as we know they'll have the same relationship as `Producer<Cat>` and `Producer<Animal>`.

Note that this logic can only be used when we're examining two instantiations of the same type.
If we have a `Producer<T>` and a `FastProducer<U>`, there's no guarantee that `T` and `U` necessarily refer to the same positions in these types, so this check will always be performed structurally.

Because variance is a naturally emergent property of structural types, TypeScript automatically *infers* the variance of every generic type.
**In extremely rare cases** involving certain kinds of circular types, this measurement can be inaccurate.
If this happens, you can add a variance annotation to a type parameter to force a particular variance:
```ts
// Contravariant annotation
interface Consumer<in T> {
  consume: (arg: T) => void;
}

// Covariant annotation
interface Producer<out T> {
  make(): T;
}

// Invariant annotation
interface ProducerConsumer<in out T> {
  consume: (arg: T) => void;
  make(): T;
}
```
Only do this if you are writing the same variance that *should* occur structurally.

> Never write a variance annotation that doesn't match the structural variance!

It's critical to reinforce that variance annotations are only in effect during an instantiation-based comparison.
They have no effect during a structural comparison.
For example, you can't use variance annotations to "force" a type to be actually invariant:
```ts
// DON'T DO THIS - variance annotation
// does not match structural behavior
interface Producer<in out T> {
  make(): T;
}

// Not a type error -- this is a structural
// comparison, so variance annotations are
// not in effect
const p: Producer<string | number> = {
    make(): number {
        return 42;
    }
}
```
Here, the object literal's `make` function returns `number`, which we might expect to cause an error because `number` isn't `string | number`.
However, this isn't an instantiation-based comparison, because the object literal is an anonymous type, not a `Producer<string | number>`.

> Variance annotations don't change structural behavior and are only consulted in specific situations

It's very important to only write variance annotations if you absolutely know why you're doing it, what their limitations are, and when they aren't in effect.
Whether TypeScript uses an instantiation-based comparison or structural comparison is not a specified behavior and may change from version to version for correctness or performance reasons, so you should only ever write variance annotations when they match the structural behavior of a type.
Don't use variance annotations to try to "force" a particular variance; this will cause unpredictable behavior in your code.

> Do NOT write variance annotations unless they match the structural behavior of a type

Remember, TypeScript can automatically infer variance from your generic types.
It's almost never necessary to write a variance annotation, and you should only do so when you've identified a specific need.
Variance annotations *do not* change the structural behavior of a type, and depending on the situation, you might see a structural comparison made when you expected an instantiation-based comparison.
Variance annotations can't be used to modify how types behave in these structural contexts, and shouldn't be written unless the annotation is the same as the structural definition.
Because this is difficult to get right, and TypeScript can correctly infer variance in the vast majority of cases, you should not find yourself writing variance annotations in normal code.

> Don't try to use variance annotations to change typechecking behavior; this is not what they are for

You *may* find temporary variance annotations useful in a "type debugging" situation, because variance annotations are checked.
TypeScript will issue an error if the annotated variance is identifiably wrong:
```ts
// Error, this interface is definitely contravariant on T
interface Foo<out T> {
  consume: (arg: T) => void;
}
```
However, variance annotations are allowed to be stricter (e.g. `in out` is valid if the actual variance is covariant).
Be sure to remove your variance annotations once you're done debugging.

Lastly, if you're trying to maximize your typechecking performance, *and* have run a profiler, *and* have identified a specific type that's slow, *and* have identified variance inference specifically is slow, *and* have carefully validated the variance annotation you want to write, you *may* see a small performance benefit in extraordinarily complex types by adding variance annotations.
