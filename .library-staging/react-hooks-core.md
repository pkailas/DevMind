<Intro>

`useState` is a React Hook that lets you add a [state variable](/learn/state-a-components-memory) to your component.

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

</Intro>

<InlineToc />

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useState(initialState)` {/*usestate*/}

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare a [state variable.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(28);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());
  // ...
```

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `initialState`: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
  * If you pass a function as `initialState`, it will be treated as an _initializer function_. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. [See an example below.](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state)

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useState` returns an array with exactly two values:

1. The current state. During the first render, it will match the `initialState` you have passed.
2. The [`set` function](#setstate) that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useState` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your initializer function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

---

### `set` functions, like `setSomething(nextState)` {/*setstate*/}

The `set` function returned by `useState` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:

```js
const [name, setName] = useState('Edward');

function handleClick() {
  setName('Taylor');
  setAge(a => a + 1);
  // ...
```

#### Parameters {/*setstate-parameters*/}

* `nextState`: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.
  * If you pass a function as `nextState`, it will be treated as an _updater function_. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. [See an example below.](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

#### Returns {/*setstate-returns*/}

`set` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats {/*setstate-caveats*/}

* The `set` function **only updates the state variable for the *next* render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `set` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value) that was on the screen before your call.

* If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn't affect your code.

* React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)

* The `set` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

* Calling the `set` function *during rendering* is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to **store information from the previous renders**. [See an example below.](#storing-information-from-previous-renders)

* In Strict Mode, React will **call your updater function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Adding state to a component {/*adding-state-to-a-component*/}

Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare one or more [state variables.](/learn/state-a-components-memory)

```js [[1, 4, "age"], [2, 4, "setAge"], [3, 4, "42"], [1, 5, "name"], [2, 5, "setName"], [3, 5, "'Taylor'"]]
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  // ...
```

The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)

`useState` returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The <CodeStep step={1}>current state</CodeStep> of this state variable, initially set to the <CodeStep step={3}>initial state</CodeStep> you provided.
2. The <CodeStep step={2}>`set` function</CodeStep> that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.

To update what’s on the screen, call the `set` function with some next state:

```js [[2, 2, "setName"]]
function handleClick() {
  setName('Robin');
}
```

React will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.

<Pitfall>

Calling the `set` function [**does not** change the current state in the already executing code](#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value):

```js {3}
function handleClick() {
  setName('Robin');
  console.log(name); // Still "Taylor"!
}
```

It only affects what `useState` will return starting from the *next* render.

</Pitfall>



---

### Updating state based on the previous state {/*updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state*/}

Suppose the `age` is `42`. This handler calls `setAge(age + 1)` three times:

```js
function handleClick() {
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)
}
```

However, after one click, `age` will only be `43` rather than `45`! This is because calling the `set` function [does not update](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) the `age` state variable in the already running code. So each `setAge(age + 1)` call becomes `setAge(43)`.

To solve this problem, **you may pass an *updater function*** to `setAge` instead of the next state:

```js [[1, 2, "a", 0], [2, 2, "a + 1"], [1, 3, "a", 0], [2, 3, "a + 1"], [1, 4, "a", 0], [2, 4, "a + 1"]]
function handleClick() {
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)
}
```

Here, `a => a + 1` is your updater function. It takes the <CodeStep step={1}>pending state</CodeStep> and calculates the <CodeStep step={2}>next state</CodeStep> from it.

React puts your updater functions in a [queue.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:

1. `a => a + 1` will receive `42` as the pending state and return `43` as the next state.
1. `a => a + 1` will receive `43` as the pending state and return `44` as the next state.
1. `a => a + 1` will receive `44` as the pending state and return `45` as the next state.

There are no other queued updates, so React will store `45` as the current state in the end.

By convention, it's common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like `a` for `age`. However, you may also call it like `prevAge` or something else that you find clearer.

React may [call your updaters twice](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) in development to verify that they are [pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

<DeepDive>

#### Is using an updater always preferred? {/*is-using-an-updater-always-preferred*/}

You might hear a recommendation to always write code like `setAge(a => a + 1)` if the state you're setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary.

In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the `age` state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a "stale" `age` at the beginning of the event handler.

However, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They're also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders).

If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it's reasonable to always write an updater if the state you're setting is calculated from the previous state. If it's calculated from the previous state of some *other* state variable, you might want to combine them into one object and [use a reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

### Updating objects and arrays in state {/*updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state*/}

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should *replace* it rather than *mutate* your existing objects**. For example, if you have a `form` object in state, don't mutate it:

```js
// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:
form.firstName = 'Taylor';
```

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:

```js
// ✅ Replace state with a new object
setForm({
  ...form,
  firstName: 'Taylor'
});
```

Read [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) to learn more.



---

### Avoiding recreating the initial state {/*avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state*/}

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialTodos()` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useState` instead:

```js
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);
  // ...
```

Notice that you’re passing `createInitialTodos`, which is the *function itself*, and not `createInitialTodos()`, which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to `useState`, React will only call it during initialization.

React may [call your initializers twice](#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) in development to verify that they are [pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)



---

### Resetting state with a key {/*resetting-state-with-a-key*/}

You'll often encounter the `key` attribute when [rendering lists.](/learn/rendering-lists) However, it also serves another purpose.

You can **reset a component's state by passing a different `key` to a component.** In this example, the Reset button changes the `version` state variable, which we pass as a `key` to the `Form`. When the `key` changes, React re-creates the `Form` component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.

Read [preserving and resetting state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state) to learn more.



---

### Storing information from previous renders {/*storing-information-from-previous-renders*/}

Usually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering -- for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.

In most cases, you don't need this:

* **If the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, [remove that redundant state altogether.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state)** If you're worried about recomputing too often, the [`useMemo` Hook](/reference/react/useMemo) can help.
* If you want to reset the entire component tree's state, [pass a different `key` to your component.](#resetting-state-with-a-key)
* If you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.

In the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a `set` function while your component is rendering.

Here's an example. This `CountLabel` component displays the `count` prop passed to it:

```js src/CountLabel.js
export default function CountLabel({ count }) {
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}
```

Say you want to show whether the counter has *increased or decreased* since the last change. The `count` prop doesn't tell you this -- you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the `prevCount` state variable to track it. Add another state variable called `trend` to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare `prevCount` with `count`, and if they're not equal, update both `prevCount` and `trend`. Now you can show both the current count prop and *how it has changed since the last render*.



Note that if you call a `set` function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like `prevCount !== count`, and there must be a call like `setPrevCount(count)` inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the *currently rendering* component like this. Calling the `set` function of *another* component during rendering is an error. Finally, your `set` call should still [update state without mutation](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state) -- this doesn't mean you can break other rules of [pure functions.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

This pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it's better than updating state in an effect. When you call the `set` function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a `return` statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don't need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early `return;` to restart rendering earlier.

---

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### I've updated the state, but logging gives me the old value {/*ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value*/}

Calling the `set` function **does not change state in the running code**:

```js {4,5,8}
function handleClick() {
  console.log(count);  // 0

  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1
  console.log(count);  // Still 0!

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(count); // Also 0!
  }, 5000);
}
```

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `count` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the `set` function:

```js
const nextCount = count + 1;
setCount(nextCount);

console.log(count);     // 0
console.log(nextCount); // 1
```

---

### I've updated the state, but the screen doesn't update {/*ive-updated-the-state-but-the-screen-doesnt-update*/}

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

```js
obj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object
setObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything
```

You mutated an existing `obj` object and passed it back to `setObj`, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you're always [_replacing_ objects and arrays in state instead of _mutating_ them](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```js
// ✅ Correct: creating a new object
setObj({
  ...obj,
  x: 10
});
```

---

### I'm getting an error: "Too many re-renders" {/*im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders*/}

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you're unconditionally setting state *during render*, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

```js {1-2}
// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render
return <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function
return <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```

If you can't find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `set` function call responsible for the error.

---

### My initializer or updater function runs twice {/*my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice*/}

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:

```js {2,5-6,11-12}
function TodoList() {
  // This component function will run twice for every render.

  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {
    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.
    return createTodos();
  });

  function handleClick() {
    setTodos(prevTodos => {
      // This updater function will run twice for every click.
      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];
    });
  }
  // ...
```

This is expected and shouldn't break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:

```js {2,3}
setTodos(prevTodos => {
  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state
  prevTodos.push(createTodo());
});
```

Because React calls your updater function twice, you'll see the todo was added twice, so you'll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```js {2,3}
setTodos(prevTodos => {
  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state
  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];
});
```

Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn't make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don't need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

Read [keeping components pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure) to learn more.

---

### I'm trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead {/*im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead*/}

You can't put a function into state like this:

```js
const [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);

function handleClick() {
  setFn(someOtherFunction);
}
```

Because you're passing a function, React assumes that `someFunction` is an [initializer function](#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state), and that `someOtherFunction` is an [updater function](#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state), so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually *store* a function, you have to put `() =>` before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.

```js {1,4}
const [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);

function handleClick() {
  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);
}
```


# Source: react.dev/src\content\reference\react\useEffect.md

---
title: useEffect
---

<Intro>

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you [synchronize a component with an external system.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```js
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

</Intro>

<InlineToc />

---

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useEffect(setup, dependencies?)` {/*useeffect*/}

Call `useEffect` at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `setup`: The function with your Effect's logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a *cleanup* function. When your [component commits](/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom), React will run your setup function. After every commit with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

* **optional** `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `setup` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every commit of the component. [See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.](#examples-dependencies)

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useEffect` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useEffect` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

* If you're **not trying to synchronize with some external system,** [you probably don't need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

* When Strict Mode is on, React will **run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle** before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic "mirrors" your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, [implement the cleanup function.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

* If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will **cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed.** To fix this, remove unnecessary [object](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies) and [function](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies) dependencies. You can also [extract state updates](#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect) and [non-reactive logic](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect) outside of your Effect.

* If your Effect wasn't caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser **paint the updated screen first before running your Effect.** If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)

* If your Effect is caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may run your Effect before the browser paints the updated screen**. This ensures that the result of the Effect can be observed by the event system. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an `alert()`, you can use `setTimeout`. See [reactwg/react-18/128](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/128) for more information.

* Even if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect.** Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)

* Effects **only run on the client.** They don't run during server rendering.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Connecting to an external system {/*connecting-to-an-external-system*/}

Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren't controlled by React, so they are called *external.*

To [connect your component to some external system,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) call `useEffect` at the top level of your component:

```js [[1, 8, "const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);"], [1, 9, "connection.connect();"], [2, 11, "connection.disconnect();"], [3, 13, "[serverUrl, roomId]"]]
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
  	const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
  	return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
  	};
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

You need to pass two arguments to `useEffect`:

1. A *setup function* with <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> that connects to that system.
   - It should return a *cleanup function* with <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> that disconnects from that system.
2. A <CodeStep step={3}>list of dependencies</CodeStep> including every value from your component used inside of those functions.

**React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it's necessary, which may happen multiple times:**

1. Your <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> runs when your component is added to the page *(mounts)*.
2. After every commit of your component where the <CodeStep step={3}>dependencies</CodeStep> have changed:
   - First, your <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> runs with the old props and state.
   - Then, your <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> runs with the new props and state.
3. Your <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> runs one final time after your component is removed from the page *(unmounts).*

**Let's illustrate this sequence for the example above.**

When the `ChatRoom` component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial `serverUrl` and `roomId`. If either `serverUrl` or `roomId` change as a result of a commit (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will *disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one.* When the `ChatRoom` component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.

**To [help you find bugs,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) in development React runs <CodeStep step={1}>setup</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup</CodeStep> one extra time before the <CodeStep step={1}>setup</CodeStep>.** This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect's logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn't be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a *setup* → *cleanup* → *setup* sequence (as in development). [See common solutions.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

**Try to [write every Effect as an independent process](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) and [think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective)** It shouldn't matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly "mirrors" the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.

<Note>

An Effect lets you [keep your component synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with some external system (like a chat service). Here, *external system* means any piece of code that's not controlled by React, such as:

* A timer managed with <CodeStep step={1}>[`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval)</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>[`clearInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval)</CodeStep>.
* An event subscription using <CodeStep step={1}>[`window.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>[`window.removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)</CodeStep>.
* A third-party animation library with an API like <CodeStep step={1}>`animation.start()`</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>`animation.reset()`</CodeStep>.

**If you're not connecting to any external system, [you probably don't need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)**

### Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks {/*wrapping-effects-in-custom-hooks*/}

Effects are an ["escape hatch":](/learn/escape-hatches) you use them when you need to "step outside React" and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it's usually a sign that you need to extract some [custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) for common behaviors your components rely on.

For example, this `useChatRoom` custom Hook "hides" the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:

```js {1,11}
function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

Then you can use it from any component like this:

```js {4-7}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```

There are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.

[Learn more about wrapping Effects in custom Hooks.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)



---

### Controlling a non-React widget {/*controlling-a-non-react-widget*/}

Sometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.

For example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a `MapWidget` class defined in `map-widget.js`. When you change the `zoomLevel` prop of the `Map` component, the Effect calls the `setZoom()` on the class instance to keep it synchronized:



In this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the `MapWidget` class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the `Map` React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the `MapWidget` class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.

---

### Fetching data with Effects {/*fetching-data-with-effects*/}

You can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that [if you use a framework,](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) using your framework's data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.

If you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchBio } from './api.js';

export default function Page() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');
  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    setBio(null);
    fetchBio(person).then(result => {
      if (!ignore) {
        setBio(result);
      }
    });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [person]);

  // ...
```

Note the `ignore` variable which is initialized to `false`, and is set to `true` during cleanup. This ensures [your code doesn't suffer from "race conditions":](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect) network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.



You can also rewrite using the [`async` / `await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:



Writing data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. [It's easier to use a custom Hook--either your own or maintained by the community.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#when-to-use-custom-hooks)

<DeepDive>

#### What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? {/*what-are-good-alternatives-to-data-fetching-in-effects*/}

Writing `fetch` calls inside Effects is a [popular way to fetch data](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/), especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides:

- **Effects don't run on the server.** This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient.
- **Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create "network waterfalls".** You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel.
- **Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don't preload or cache data.** For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again.
- **It's not very ergonomic.** There's quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing `fetch` calls in a way that doesn't suffer from bugs like [race conditions.](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect)

This list of downsides is not specific to React. It applies to fetching data on mount with any library. Like with routing, data fetching is not trivial to do well, so we recommend the following approaches:

- **If you use a [framework](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks), use its built-in data fetching mechanism.** Modern React frameworks have integrated data fetching mechanisms that are efficient and don't suffer from the above pitfalls.
- **Otherwise, consider using or building a client-side cache.** Popular open source solutions include [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/), [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [React Router 6.4+.](https://beta.reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) You can build your own solution too, in which case you would use Effects under the hood but also add logic for deduplicating requests, caching responses, and avoiding network waterfalls (by preloading data or hoisting data requirements to routes).

You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you.

### Specifying reactive dependencies {/*specifying-reactive-dependencies*/}

**Notice that you can't "choose" the dependencies of your Effect.** Every <CodeStep step={2}>reactive value</CodeStep> used by your Effect's code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect's dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:

```js [[2, 1, "roomId"], [2, 2, "serverUrl"], [2, 5, "serverUrl"], [2, 5, "roomId"], [2, 8, "serverUrl"], [2, 8, "roomId"]]
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // This is a reactive value too

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect
  // ...
}
```

If either `serverUrl` or `roomId` change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.

**[Reactive values](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component.** Since `roomId` and `serverUrl` are reactive values, you can't remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and [your linter is correctly configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:

```js {8}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl'
  // ...
}
```

**To remove a dependency, you need to ["prove" to the linter that it *doesn't need* to be a dependency.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#removing-unnecessary-dependencies)** For example, you can move `serverUrl` out of your component to prove that it's not reactive and won't change on re-renders:

```js {1,8}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now that `serverUrl` is not a reactive value (and can't change on a re-render), it doesn't need to be a dependency. **If your Effect's code doesn't use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty (`[]`):**

```js {1,2,9}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore
const roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

[An Effect with empty dependencies](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#what-an-effect-with-empty-dependencies-means) doesn't re-run when any of your component's props or state change.

<Pitfall>

If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:

```js {3-4}
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:
  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);
```

**When dependencies don't match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs.** By suppressing the linter, you "lie" to React about the values your Effect depends on. [Instead, prove they're unnecessary.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#removing-unnecessary-dependencies)

</Pitfall>

### Updating state based on previous state from an Effect {/*updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect*/}

When you want to update state based on previous state from an Effect, you might run into a problem:

```js {6,9}
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1); // You want to increment the counter every second...
    }, 1000)
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, [count]); // 🚩 ... but specifying `count` as a dependency always resets the interval.
  // ...
}
```

Since `count` is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the `count` changes. This is not ideal.

To fix this, [pass the `c => c + 1` state updater](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) to `setCount`:



Now that you're passing `c => c + 1` instead of `count + 1`, [your Effect no longer needs to depend on `count`.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#are-you-reading-some-state-to-calculate-the-next-state) As a result of this fix, it won't need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the `count` changes.

---


### Removing unnecessary object dependencies {/*removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies*/}

If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every commit because the `options` object is [different for every render:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally)

```js {6-9,12,15}
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a commit
  // ...
```

Avoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:



Now that you create the `options` object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the `roomId` string.

With this fix, typing into the input doesn't reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like `roomId` doesn't change unless you set it to another value. [Read more about removing dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

---

### Removing unnecessary function dependencies {/*removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies*/}

If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every commit because the `createOptions` function is [different for every render:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#does-some-reactive-value-change-unintentionally)

```js {4-9,12,16}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  function createOptions() { // 🚩 This function is created from scratch on every re-render
    return {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions(); // It's used inside the Effect
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a commit
  // ...
```

By itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don't need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every commit.

Avoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, declare it inside the Effect:



Now that you define the `createOptions` function inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the `roomId` string. With this fix, typing into the input doesn't reconnect the chat. Unlike a function which gets re-created, a string like `roomId` doesn't change unless you set it to another value. [Read more about removing dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

---

### Reading the latest props and state from an Effect {/*reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect*/}

By default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect "reacts" to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that's the behavior you want.

**However, sometimes you'll want to read the *latest* props and state from an Effect without "reacting" to them.** For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:

```js {3}
function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length);
  }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

**What if you want to log a new page visit after every `url` change, but *not* if only the `shoppingCart` changes?** You can't exclude `shoppingCart` from dependencies without breaking the [reactivity rules.](#specifying-reactive-dependencies) However, you can express that you *don't want* a piece of code to "react" to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. [Declare an *Effect Event*](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#declaring-an-effect-event) with the [`useEffectEvent`](/reference/react/useEffectEvent) Hook, and move the code reading `shoppingCart` inside of it:

```js {2-4,7,8}
function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {
  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {
    logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length)
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    onVisit(url);
  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

**Effect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect.** This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading `shoppingCart` inside of `onVisit`, you ensure that `shoppingCart` won't re-run your Effect.

[Read more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects#reading-latest-props-and-state-with-effect-events)

### Displaying different content on the server and the client {/*displaying-different-content-on-the-server-and-the-client*/}

If your app uses server rendering (either [directly](/reference/react-dom/server) or via a [framework](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks)), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for [hydration](/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.

In rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), it can't possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:


{/* TODO(@poteto) - investigate potential false positives in react compiler validation */}
```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [5]}}
function MyComponent() {
  const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setDidMount(true);
  }, []);

  if (didMount) {
    // ... return client-only JSX ...
  }  else {
    // ... return initial JSX ...
  }
}
```

While the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it's loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set `didMount` to `true`, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don't run on the server, so this is why `didMount` was `false` during the initial server render.

Use this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time--potentially, many seconds--so you don't want to make jarring changes to your component's appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### My Effect runs twice when the component mounts {/*my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts*/}

When Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.

This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).

Read more about [how this helps find bugs](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) and [how to fix your logic.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

---

### My Effect runs after every re-render {/*my-effect-runs-after-every-re-render*/}

First, check that you haven't forgotten to specify the dependency array:

```js {3}
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}); // 🚩 No dependency array: re-runs after every commit!
```

If you've specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it's because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.

You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

```js {5}
  useEffect(() => {
    // ..
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);

  console.log([serverUrl, roomId]);
```

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select "Store as a global variable" for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

```js
Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...
```

When you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:

- [Updating state based on previous state from an Effect](#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect)
- [Removing unnecessary object dependencies](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies)
- [Removing unnecessary function dependencies](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies)
- [Reading the latest props and state from an Effect](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect)

As a last resort (if these methods didn't help), wrap its creation with [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook) or [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback#preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often) (for functions).

---

### My Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle {/*my-effect-keeps-re-running-in-an-infinite-cycle*/}

If your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:

- Your Effect is updating some state.
- That state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect's dependencies to change.

Before you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application's data flow with it?

If there is no external system, consider whether [removing the Effect altogether](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) would simplify your logic.

If you're genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component's visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn't used by rendering, a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#referencing-a-value-with-a-ref) (which doesn't trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn't update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.

Finally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it's because that state update leads to one of the Effect's dependencies changing. [Read how to debug dependency changes.](/reference/react/useEffect#my-effect-runs-after-every-re-render)

---

### My cleanup logic runs even though my component didn't unmount {/*my-cleanup-logic-runs-even-though-my-component-didnt-unmount*/}

The cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React [runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.](#my-effect-runs-twice-when-the-component-mounts)

If you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it's usually a code smell:

```js {2-5}
useEffect(() => {
  // 🔴 Avoid: Cleanup logic without corresponding setup logic
  return () => {
    doSomething();
  };
}, []);
```

Your cleanup logic should be "symmetrical" to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:

```js {2-3,5}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
```

---

### My Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs {/*my-effect-does-something-visual-and-i-see-a-flicker-before-it-runs*/}

If your Effect must block the browser from [painting the screen,](/learn/render-and-commit#epilogue-browser-paint) replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect). Note that **this shouldn't be needed for the vast majority of Effects.** You'll only need this if it's crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.


# Source: react.dev/src\content\reference\react\useCallback.md

title: useCallback
---

<Intro>

`useCallback` is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

```js
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)
```

</Intro>

<Note>

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual `useCallback` calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.

</Note>

<InlineToc />

---

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useCallback(fn, dependencies)` {/*usecallback*/}

Call `useCallback` at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:

```js {4,9}
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `fn`: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the `dependencies` have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.

* `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `fn` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison algorithm.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

On the initial render, `useCallback` returns the `fn` function you have passed.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored `fn` function from the last render (if the dependencies haven't changed), or return the `fn` function you have passed during this render.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useCallback` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* React **will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that.** For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache--for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on `useCallback` as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a [state variable](/reference/react/useState#im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead) or a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) may be more appropriate.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Skipping re-rendering of components {/*skipping-re-rendering-of-components*/}

When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let's first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it's useful.

To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the `useCallback` Hook:

```js [[3, 4, "handleSubmit"], [2, 9, "[productId, referrer]"]]
import { useCallback } from 'react';

function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
  // ...
```

You need to pass two things to `useCallback`:

1. A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.
2. A <CodeStep step={2}>list of dependencies</CodeStep> including every value within your component that's used inside your function.

On the initial render, the <CodeStep step={3}>returned function</CodeStep> you'll get from `useCallback` will be the function you passed.

On the following renders, React will compare the <CodeStep step={2}>dependencies</CodeStep> with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), `useCallback` will return the same function as before. Otherwise, `useCallback` will return the function you passed on *this* render.

In other words, `useCallback` caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.

**Let's walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

Say you're passing a `handleSubmit` function down from the `ProductPage` to the `ShippingForm` component:

```js {5}
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // ...
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
```

You've noticed that toggling the `theme` prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove `<ShippingForm />` from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it's worth trying to optimize the `ShippingForm` component.

**By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.** This is why, when `ProductPage` re-renders with a different `theme`, the `ShippingForm` component *also* re-renders. This is fine for components that don't require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell `ShippingForm` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in [`memo`:](/reference/react/memo)

```js {3,5}
import { memo } from 'react';

const ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {
  // ...
});
```

**With this change, `ShippingForm` will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the *same* as on the last render.** This is when caching a function becomes important! Let's say you defined `handleSubmit` without `useCallback`:

```js {2,3,8,12-13}
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...
  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**In JavaScript, a `function () {}` or `() => {}` always creates a _different_ function,** similar to how the `{}` object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but it means that `ShippingForm` props will never be the same, and your [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) optimization won't work. This is where `useCallback` comes in handy:

```js {2,3,8,12-13}
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}
      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**By wrapping `handleSubmit` in `useCallback`, you ensure that it's the *same* function between the re-renders** (until dependencies change). You don't *have to* wrap a function in `useCallback` unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in [`memo`,](/reference/react/memo) and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need `useCallback` which are described further on this page.

<Note>

**You should only rely on `useCallback` as a performance optimization.** If your code doesn't work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add `useCallback` back.

</Note>

<DeepDive>

#### How is useCallback related to useMemo? {/*how-is-usecallback-related-to-usememo*/}

You will often see [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) alongside `useCallback`. They are both useful when you're trying to optimize a child component. They let you [memoize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) (or, in other words, cache) something you're passing down:

```js {6-8,10-15,19}
import { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  const product = useData('/product/' + productId);

  const requirements = useMemo(() => { // Calls your function and caches its result
    return computeRequirements(product);
  }, [product]);

  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { // Caches your function itself
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <ShippingForm requirements={requirements} onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The difference is in *what* they're letting you cache:

* **[`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) caches the *result* of calling your function.** In this example, it caches the result of calling `computeRequirements(product)` so that it doesn't change unless `product` has changed. This lets you pass the `requirements` object down without unnecessarily re-rendering `ShippingForm`. When necessary, React will call the function you've passed during rendering to calculate the result.
* **`useCallback` caches *the function itself.*** Unlike `useMemo`, it does not call the function you provide. Instead, it caches the function you provided so that `handleSubmit` *itself* doesn't change unless `productId` or `referrer` has changed. This lets you pass the `handleSubmit` function down without unnecessarily re-rendering `ShippingForm`. Your code won't run until the user submits the form.

If you're already familiar with [`useMemo`,](/reference/react/useMemo) you might find it helpful to think of `useCallback` as this:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [3]}}
// Simplified implementation (inside React)
function useCallback(fn, dependencies) {
  return useMemo(() => fn, dependencies);
}
```

<DeepDive>

#### Should you add useCallback everywhere? {/*should-you-add-usecallback-everywhere*/}

If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.

Caching a function with `useCallback` is only valuable in a few cases:

- You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn't changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only if dependencies changed.
- The function you're passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, another function wrapped in `useCallback` depends on it, or you depend on this function from [`useEffect.`](/reference/react/useEffect)

There is no benefit to wrapping a function in `useCallback` in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that's "always new" is enough to break memoization for an entire component.

Note that `useCallback` does not prevent *creating* the function. You're always creating a function (and that's fine!), but React ignores it and gives you back a cached function if nothing changed.

**In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:**

1. When a component visually wraps other components, let it [accept JSX as children.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) Then, if the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don't need to re-render.
2. Prefer local state and don't [lift state up](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) any further than necessary. Don't keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.
3. Keep your [rendering logic pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it's a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.
4. Avoid [unnecessary Effects that update state.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.
5. Try to [remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) For example, instead of memoization, it's often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.

If a specific interaction still feels laggy, [use the React Developer Tools profiler](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) to see which components benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it's good to follow them in any case. In long term, we're researching [doing memoization automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc) to solve this once and for all.

### Updating state from a memoized callback {/*updating-state-from-a-memoized-callback*/}

Sometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.

This `handleAddTodo` function specifies `todos` as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:

```js {6,7}
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  }, [todos]);
  // ...
```

You'll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an [updater function](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) instead:

```js {6,7}
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {
    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };
    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);
  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency
  // ...
```

Here, instead of making `todos` a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about *how* to update the state (`todos => [...todos, newTodo]`) to React. [Read more about updater functions.](/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state)

---

### Preventing an Effect from firing too often {/*preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often*/}

Sometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an [Effect:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```js {4-9,12}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  function createOptions() {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

This creates a problem. [Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) However, if you declare `createOptions` as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:


```js {6}
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render
  // ...
```

To solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into `useCallback`:

```js {4-9,16}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes
  // ...
```

This ensures that the `createOptions` function is the same between re-renders if the `roomId` is the same. **However, it's even better to remove the need for a function dependency.** Move your function *inside* the Effect:

```js {5-10,16}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!
      return {
        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
        roomId: roomId
      };
    }

    const options = createOptions();
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes
  // ...
```

Now your code is simpler and doesn't need `useCallback`. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)

---

### Optimizing a custom Hook {/*optimizing-a-custom-hook*/}

If you're writing a [custom Hook,](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) it's recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into `useCallback`:

```js {4-6,8-10}
function useRouter() {
  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);

  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });
  }, [dispatch]);

  const goBack = useCallback(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'back' });
  }, [dispatch]);

  return {
    navigate,
    goBack,
  };
}
```

This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.

---

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### Every time my component renders, `useCallback` returns a different function {/*every-time-my-component-renders-usecallback-returns-a-different-function*/}

Make sure you've specified the dependency array as a second argument!

If you forget the dependency array, `useCallback` will return a new function every time:

```js {7}
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array
  // ...
```

This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:

```js {7}
function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily
  // ...
```

If this doesn't help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

```js {5}
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    // ..
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  console.log([productId, referrer]);
```

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select "Store as a global variable" for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

```js
Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...
```

When you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or [memoize it as well.](/reference/react/useMemo#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)

---

### I need to call `useCallback` for each list item in a loop, but it's not allowed {/*i-need-to-call-usememo-for-each-list-item-in-a-loop-but-its-not-allowed*/}

Suppose the `Chart` component is wrapped in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo). You want to skip re-rendering every `Chart` in the list when the `ReportList` component re-renders. However, you can't call `useCallback` in a loop:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [6]}} {5-14}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item => {
        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:
        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
          sendReport(item)
        }, [item]);

        return (
          <figure key={item.id}>
            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
          </figure>
        );
      })}
    </article>
  );
}
```

Instead, extract a component for an individual item, and put `useCallback` there:

```js {5,12-21}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item =>
        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />
      )}
    </article>
  );
}

function Report({ item }) {
  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    sendReport(item)
  }, [item]);

  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
    </figure>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you could remove `useCallback` in the last snippet and instead wrap `Report` itself in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) If the `item` prop does not change, `Report` will skip re-rendering, so `Chart` will skip re-rendering too:

```js {5,6-8,15}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  // ...
}

const Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {
  function handleClick() {
    sendReport(item);
  }

  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />
    </figure>
  );
});
```

<Intro>

`useMemo` is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

```js
const cachedValue = useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)
```

</Intro>

<Note>

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual `useMemo` calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useMemo(calculateValue, dependencies)` {/*usememo*/}

Call `useMemo` at the top level of your component to cache a calculation between re-renders:

```js
import { useMemo } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(
    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),
    [todos, tab]
  );
  // ...
}
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `calculateValue`: The function calculating the value that you want to cache. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the `dependencies` have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call `calculateValue`, return its result, and store it so it can be reused later.

* `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `calculateValue` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

On the initial render, `useMemo` returns the result of calling `calculateValue` with no arguments.

During next renders, it will either return an already stored value from the last render (if the dependencies haven't changed), or call `calculateValue` again, and return the result that `calculateValue` has returned.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useMemo` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your calculation function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.
* React **will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that.** For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache--for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on `useMemo` solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a [state variable](/reference/react/useState#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state) or a [ref](/reference/react/useRef#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) may be more appropriate.

<Note>

Caching return values like this is also known as [*memoization*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) which is why this Hook is called `useMemo`.

</Note>

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Skipping expensive recalculations {/*skipping-expensive-recalculations*/}

To cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a `useMemo` call at the top level of your component:

```js [[3, 4, "visibleTodos"], [1, 4, "() => filterTodos(todos, tab)"], [2, 4, "[todos, tab]"]]
import { useMemo } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
  // ...
}
```

You need to pass two things to `useMemo`:

1. A <CodeStep step={1}>calculation function</CodeStep> that takes no arguments, like `() =>`, and returns what you wanted to calculate.
2. A <CodeStep step={2}>list of dependencies</CodeStep> including every value within your component that's used inside your calculation.

On the initial render, the <CodeStep step={3}>value</CodeStep> you'll get from `useMemo` will be the result of calling your <CodeStep step={1}>calculation</CodeStep>.

On every subsequent render, React will compare the <CodeStep step={2}>dependencies</CodeStep> with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), `useMemo` will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.

In other words, `useMemo` caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.

**Let's walk through an example to see when this is useful.**

By default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this `TodoList` updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the `filterTodos` function will re-run:

```js {2}
function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);
  // ...
}
```

Usually, this isn't a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you're filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn't changed. If both `todos` and `tab` are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in `useMemo` like earlier lets you reuse `visibleTodos` you've already calculated before.

This type of caching is called *[memoization.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)*

<Note>

**You should only rely on `useMemo` as a performance optimization.** If your code doesn't work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add `useMemo` to improve performance.

</Note>

<DeepDive>

#### How to tell if a calculation is expensive? {/*how-to-tell-if-a-calculation-is-expensive*/}

In general, unless you're creating or looping over thousands of objects, it's probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:

```js {1,3}
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

Perform the interaction you're measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `1ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:

```js
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
  return filterTodos(todos, tab); // Skipped if todos and tab haven't changed
}, [todos, tab]);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

`useMemo` won't make the *first* render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.

Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.

#### Should you add useMemo everywhere? {/*should-you-add-usememo-everywhere*/}

If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.

Optimizing with `useMemo`  is only valuable in a few cases:

- The calculation you're putting in `useMemo` is noticeably slow, and its dependencies rarely change.
- You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn't changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only when dependencies aren't the same.
- The value you're passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, maybe another `useMemo` calculation value depends on it. Or maybe you are depending on this value from [`useEffect.`](/reference/react/useEffect)

There is no benefit to wrapping a calculation in `useMemo` in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that's "always new" is enough to break memoization for an entire component.

**In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:**

1. When a component visually wraps other components, let it [accept JSX as children.](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don't need to re-render.
1. Prefer local state and don't [lift state up](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) any further than necessary. For example, don't keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library.
1. Keep your [rendering logic pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it's a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization.
1. Avoid [unnecessary Effects that update state.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.
1. Try to [remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) For example, instead of memoization, it's often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component.

If a specific interaction still feels laggy, [use the React Developer Tools profiler](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html) to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it's good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we're researching [doing granular memoization automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc) to solve this once and for all.

### Skipping re-rendering of components {/*skipping-re-rendering-of-components*/}

In some cases, `useMemo` can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let's say this `TodoList` component passes the `visibleTodos` as a prop to the child `List` component:

```js {5}
export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  // ...
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      <List items={visibleTodos} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

You've noticed that toggling the `theme` prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove `<List />` from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it's worth trying to optimize the `List` component.

**By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively.** This is why, when `TodoList` re-renders with a different `theme`, the `List` component *also* re-renders. This is fine for components that don't require much calculation to re-render. But if you've verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell `List` to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in [`memo`:](/reference/react/memo)

```js {3,5}
import { memo } from 'react';

const List = memo(function List({ items }) {
  // ...
});
```

**With this change, `List` will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the *same* as on the last render.** This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated `visibleTodos` without `useMemo`:

```js {2-3,6-7}
export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array...
  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}
      <List items={visibleTodos} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**In the above example, the `filterTodos` function always creates a *different* array,** similar to how the `{}` object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but it means that `List` props will never be the same, and your [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) optimization won't work. This is where `useMemo` comes in handy:

```js {2-3,5,9-10}
export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders...
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(
    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),
    [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...
  );
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}
      <List items={visibleTodos} />
    </div>
  );
}
```


**By wrapping the `visibleTodos` calculation in `useMemo`, you ensure that it has the *same* value between the re-renders** (until dependencies change). You don't *have to* wrap a calculation in `useMemo` unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in [`memo`,](/reference/react/memo) and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add `useMemo` which are described further on this page.

<DeepDive>

#### Memoizing individual JSX nodes {/*memoizing-individual-jsx-nodes*/}

Instead of wrapping `List` in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo), you could wrap the `<List />` JSX node itself in `useMemo`:

```js {3,6}
export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
  const children = useMemo(() => <List items={visibleTodos} />, [visibleTodos]);
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The behavior would be the same. If the `visibleTodos` haven't changed, `List` won't be re-rendered.

A JSX node like `<List items={visibleTodos} />` is an object like `{ type: List, props: { items: visibleTodos } }`. Creating this object is very cheap, but React doesn't know whether its contents is the same as last time or not. This is why by default, React will re-render the `List` component.

However, if React sees the same exact JSX as during the previous render, it won't try to re-render your component. This is because JSX nodes are [immutable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) A JSX node object could not have changed over time, so React knows it's safe to skip a re-render. However, for this to work, the node has to *actually be the same object*, not merely look the same in code. This is what `useMemo` does in this example.

Manually wrapping JSX nodes into `useMemo` is not convenient. For example, you can't do this conditionally. This is usually why you would wrap components with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) instead of wrapping JSX nodes.

### Preventing an Effect from firing too often {/*preventing-an-effect-from-firing-too-often*/}

Sometimes, you might want to use a value inside an [Effect:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```js {4-7,10}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const options = {
    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
    roomId: roomId
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

This creates a problem. [Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#react-verifies-that-you-specified-every-reactive-value-as-a-dependency) However, if you declare `options` as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:


```js {5}
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render
  // ...
```

To solve this, you can wrap the object you need to call from an Effect in `useMemo`:

```js {4-9,16}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const options = useMemo(() => {
    return {
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    };
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [options]); // ✅ Only changes when options changes
  // ...
```

This ensures that the `options` object is the same between re-renders if `useMemo` returns the cached object.

However, since `useMemo` is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if [there is a specific reason to do that](#caveats). This will also cause the effect to re-fire, **so it's even better to remove the need for a function dependency** by moving your object *inside* the Effect:

```js {5-8,13}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = { // ✅ No need for useMemo or object dependencies!
      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',
      roomId: roomId
    }

    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes
  // ...
```

Now your code is simpler and doesn't need `useMemo`. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)


### Memoizing a dependency of another Hook {/*memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook*/}

Suppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:

```js {2}
function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {
  const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };

  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {
    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);
  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body
  // ...
```

Depending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. **The lines of code creating the `searchOptions` object will also run on every re-render.** Since `searchOptions` is a dependency of your `useMemo` call, and it's different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate `searchItems` every time.

To fix this, you could memoize the `searchOptions` object *itself* before passing it as a dependency:

```js {2-4}
function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {
  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {
    return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };
  }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes

  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {
    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);
  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes
  // ...
```

In the example above, if the `text` did not change, the `searchOptions` object also won't change. However, an even better fix is to move the `searchOptions` object declaration *inside* of the `useMemo` calculation function:

```js {3}
function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {
  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {
    const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };
    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);
  }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes
  // ...
```

Now your calculation depends on `text` directly (which is a string and can't "accidentally" become different).

---

### Memoizing a function {/*memoizing-a-function*/}

Suppose the `Form` component is wrapped in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) You want to pass a function to it as a prop:

```js {2-7}
export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {
  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails
    });
  }

  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
}
```

Just as `{}` creates a different object, function declarations like `function() {}` and expressions like `() => {}` produce a *different* function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the `Form` component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is *always* different would defeat the point of memoization.

To memoize a function with `useMemo`, your calculation function would have to return another function:

```js {2-3,8-9}
export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {
    return (orderDetails) => {
      post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
        referrer,
        orderDetails
      });
    };
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
}
```

This looks clunky! **Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) instead of `useMemo`** to avoid having to write an extra nested function:

```js {2,7}
export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
}
```

The two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to `useCallback` is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn't do anything else. [Read more about `useCallback`.](/reference/react/useCallback)

---

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### My calculation runs twice on every re-render {/*my-calculation-runs-twice-on-every-re-render*/}

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:

```js {2,5,6}
function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
  // This component function will run twice for every render.

  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // This calculation will run twice if any of the dependencies change.
    return filterTodos(todos, tab);
  }, [todos, tab]);

  // ...
```

This is expected and shouldn't break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.

For example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:

```js {2-3}
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop
    todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });
    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);
    return filtered;
  }, [todos, tab]);
```

React calls your function twice, so you'd notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn't change any existing objects, but it's okay to change any *new* objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the `filterTodos` function always returns a *different* array, you can mutate *that* array instead:

```js {3,4}
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);
    // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation
    filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });
    return filtered;
  }, [todos, tab]);
```

Read [keeping components pure](/learn/keeping-components-pure) to learn more about purity.

Also, check out the guides on [updating objects](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) without mutation.

---

### My `useMemo` call is supposed to return an object, but returns undefined {/*my-usememo-call-is-supposed-to-return-an-object-but-returns-undefined*/}

This code doesn't work:

```js {1-2,5}
  // 🔴 You can't return an object from an arrow function with () => {
  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {
    matchMode: 'whole-word',
    text: text
  }, [text]);
```

In JavaScript, `() => {` starts the arrow function body, so the `{` brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn't return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like `({` and `})`:

```js {1-2,5}
  // This works, but is easy for someone to break again
  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => ({
    matchMode: 'whole-word',
    text: text
  }), [text]);
```

However, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.

To avoid this mistake, write a `return` statement explicitly:

```js {1-3,6-7}
  // ✅ This works and is explicit
  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {
    return {
      matchMode: 'whole-word',
      text: text
    };
  }, [text]);
```

---

### Every time my component renders, the calculation in `useMemo` re-runs {/*every-time-my-component-renders-the-calculation-in-usememo-re-runs*/}

Make sure you've specified the dependency array as a second argument!

If you forget the dependency array, `useMemo` will re-run the calculation every time:

```js {2-3}
function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
  // 🔴 Recalculates every time: no dependency array
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab));
  // ...
```

This is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:

```js {2-3}
function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
  // ✅ Does not recalculate unnecessarily
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
  // ...
```

If this doesn't help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:

```js
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
  console.log([todos, tab]);
```

You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select "Store as a global variable" for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as `temp1` and the second one got saved as `temp2`, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:

```js
Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?
Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...
```

When you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or [memoize it as well.](#memoizing-a-dependency-of-another-hook)

---

### I need to call `useMemo` for each list item in a loop, but it's not allowed {/*i-need-to-call-usememo-for-each-list-item-in-a-loop-but-its-not-allowed*/}

Suppose the `Chart` component is wrapped in [`memo`](/reference/react/memo). You want to skip re-rendering every `Chart` in the list when the `ReportList` component re-renders. However, you can't call `useMemo` in a loop:

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [6]}} {5-11}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item => {
        // 🔴 You can't call useMemo in a loop like this:
        const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);
        return (
          <figure key={item.id}>
            <Chart data={data} />
          </figure>
        );
      })}
    </article>
  );
}
```

Instead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:

```js {5,12-18}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {items.map(item =>
        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />
      )}
    </article>
  );
}

function Report({ item }) {
  // ✅ Call useMemo at the top level:
  const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);
  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart data={data} />
    </figure>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you could remove `useMemo` and instead wrap `Report` itself in [`memo`.](/reference/react/memo) If the `item` prop does not change, `Report` will skip re-rendering, so `Chart` will skip re-rendering too:

```js {5,6,12}
function ReportList({ items }) {
  // ...
}

const Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {
  const data = calculateReport(item);
  return (
    <figure>
      <Chart data={data} />
    </figure>
  );
});
```


# Source: react.dev/src\content\reference\react\useRef.md

---
title: useRef
---

<Intro>

`useRef` is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.

```js
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
```

</Intro>

<InlineToc />

---

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useRef(initialValue)` {/*useref*/}

Call `useRef` at the top level of your component to declare a [ref.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const intervalRef = useRef(0);
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  // ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `initialValue`: The value you want the ref object's `current` property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useRef` returns an object with a single property:

* `current`: Initially, it's set to the `initialValue` you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a `ref` attribute to a JSX node, React will set its `current` property.

On the next renders, `useRef` will return the same object.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* You can mutate the `ref.current` property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn't mutate that object.
* When you change the `ref.current` property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.
* Do not write _or read_ `ref.current` during rendering, except for [initialization.](#avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents) This makes your component's behavior unpredictable.
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your component function twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](/reference/react/useState#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.

---

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Referencing a value with a ref {/*referencing-a-value-with-a-ref*/}

Call `useRef` at the top level of your component to declare one or more [refs.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs)

```js [[1, 4, "intervalRef"], [3, 4, "0"]]
import { useRef } from 'react';

function Stopwatch() {
  const intervalRef = useRef(0);
  // ...
```

`useRef` returns a <CodeStep step={1}>ref object</CodeStep> with a single <CodeStep step={2}>`current` property</CodeStep> initially set to the <CodeStep step={3}>initial value</CodeStep> you provided.

On the next renders, `useRef` will return the same object. You can change its `current` property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of [state](/reference/react/useState), but there is an important difference.

**Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.** This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn't affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an [interval ID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its <CodeStep step={2}>`current` property</CodeStep>:

```js [[2, 5, "intervalRef.current"]]
function handleStartClick() {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    // ...
  }, 1000);
  intervalRef.current = intervalId;
}
```

Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call [clear that interval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval):

```js [[2, 2, "intervalRef.current"]]
function handleStopClick() {
  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;
  clearInterval(intervalId);
}
```

By using a ref, you ensure that:

- You can **store information** between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
- Changing it **does not trigger a re-render** (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
- The **information is local** to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).

Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about [choosing between `useRef` and `useState`.](/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#differences-between-refs-and-state)



<Pitfall>

**Do not write _or read_ `ref.current` during rendering.**

React expects that the body of your component [behaves like a pure function](/learn/keeping-components-pure):

- If the inputs ([props](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component), [state](/learn/state-a-components-memory), and [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
- Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.

Reading or writing a ref **during rendering** breaks these expectations.

```js {expectedErrors: {'react-compiler': [4]}} {3-4,6-7}
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering
  myRef.current = 123;
  // ...
  // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering
  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;
}
```

You can read or write refs **from event handlers or effects instead**.

```js {4-5,9-10}
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects
    myRef.current = 123;
  });
  // ...
  function handleClick() {
    // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers
    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);
  }
  // ...
}
```

If you *have to* read [or write](/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) something during rendering, [use state](/reference/react/useState) instead.

When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we're adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about [keeping your components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure#where-you-_can_-cause-side-effects)

### Manipulating the DOM with a ref {/*manipulating-the-dom-with-a-ref*/}

It's particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the [DOM.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API) React has built-in support for this.

First, declare a <CodeStep step={1}>ref object</CodeStep> with an <CodeStep step={3}>initial value</CodeStep> of `null`:

```js [[1, 4, "inputRef"], [3, 4, "null"]]
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  // ...
```

Then pass your ref object as the `ref` attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:

```js [[1, 2, "inputRef"]]
  // ...
  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
```

After React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the <CodeStep step={2}>`current` property</CodeStep> of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the `<input>`'s DOM node and call methods like [`focus()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus):

```js [[2, 2, "inputRef.current"]]
  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }
```

React will set the `current` property back to `null` when the node is removed from the screen.

### Avoiding recreating the ref contents {/*avoiding-recreating-the-ref-contents*/}

React saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function Video() {
  const playerRef = useRef(new VideoPlayer());
  // ...
```

Although the result of `new VideoPlayer()` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating expensive objects.

To solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:

```js
function Video() {
  const playerRef = useRef(null);
  if (playerRef.current === null) {
    playerRef.current = new VideoPlayer();
  }
  // ...
```

Normally, writing or reading `ref.current` during render is not allowed. However, it's fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so it's fully predictable.

#### How to avoid null checks when initializing useRef later {/*how-to-avoid-null-checks-when-initializing-use-ref-later*/}

If you use a type checker and don't want to always check for `null`, you can try a pattern like this instead:

```js
function Video() {
  const playerRef = useRef(null);

  function getPlayer() {
    if (playerRef.current !== null) {
      return playerRef.current;
    }
    const player = new VideoPlayer();
    playerRef.current = player;
    return player;
  }

  // ...
```

Here, the `playerRef` itself is nullable. However, you should be able to convince your type checker that there is no case in which `getPlayer()` returns `null`. Then use `getPlayer()` in your event handlers.

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### I can't get a ref to a custom component {/*i-cant-get-a-ref-to-a-custom-component*/}

If you try to pass a `ref` to your own component like this:

```js
const inputRef = useRef(null);

return <MyInput ref={inputRef} />;
```

You might get an error in the console:

<ConsoleBlock level="error">

TypeError: Cannot read properties of null

</ConsoleBlock>

By default, your own components don't expose refs to the DOM nodes inside them.

To fix this, find the component that you want to get a ref to:

```js
export default function MyInput({ value, onChange }) {
  return (
    <input
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

And then add `ref` to the list of props your component accepts and pass `ref` as a prop to the relevant child [built-in component](/reference/react-dom/components/common) like this:

```js {1,6}
function MyInput({ value, onChange, ref }) {
  return (
    <input
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
      ref={ref}
    />
  );
};

export default MyInput;
```

Then the parent component can get a ref to it.
