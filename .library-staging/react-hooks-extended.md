<Intro>

`useReducer` is a React Hook that lets you add a [reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to your component.

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)
```

</Intro>

<InlineToc />

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)` {/*usereducer*/}

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage its state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

```js
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `reducer`: The reducer function that specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.
* `initialArg`: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next `init` argument.
* **optional** `init`: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it's not specified, the initial state is set to `initialArg`. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling `init(initialArg)`.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two values:

1. The current state. During the first render, it's set to `init(initialArg)` or `initialArg` (if there's no `init`).
2. The [`dispatch` function](#dispatch) that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useReducer` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.
* The `dispatch` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)
* In Strict Mode, React will **call your reducer and initializer twice** in order to [help you find accidental impurities.](#my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice) This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.

---

### `dispatch` function {/*dispatch*/}

The `dispatch` function returned by `useReducer` lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the `dispatch` function:

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });

function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  // ...
```

React will set the next state to the result of calling the `reducer` function you've provided with the current `state` and the action you've passed to `dispatch`.

#### Parameters {/*dispatch-parameters*/}

* `action`: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a `type` property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.

#### Returns {/*dispatch-returns*/}

`dispatch` functions do not have a return value.

#### Caveats {/*setstate-caveats*/}

* The `dispatch` function **only updates the state variable for the *next* render**. If you read the state variable after calling the `dispatch` function, [you will still get the old value](#ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value) that was on the screen before your call.

* If the new value you provide is identical to the current `state`, as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison, React will **skip re-rendering the component and its children.** This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn't affect your code.

* React [batches state updates.](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) It updates the screen **after all the event handlers have run** and have called their `set` functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use [`flushSync`.](/reference/react-dom/flushSync)

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Adding a reducer to a component {/*adding-a-reducer-to-a-component*/}

Call `useReducer` at the top level of your component to manage state with a [reducer.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)

```js [[1, 8, "state"], [2, 8, "dispatch"], [4, 8, "reducer"], [3, 8, "{ age: 42 }"]]
import { useReducer } from 'react';

function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
  // ...
```

`useReducer` returns an array with exactly two items:

1. The <CodeStep step={1}>current state</CodeStep> of this state variable, initially set to the <CodeStep step={3}>initial state</CodeStep> you provided.
2. The <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch` function</CodeStep> that lets you change it in response to interaction.

To update what's on the screen, call <CodeStep step={2}>`dispatch`</CodeStep> with an object representing what the user did, called an *action*:

```js [[2, 2, "dispatch"]]
function handleClick() {
  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
}
```

React will pass the current state and the action to your <CodeStep step={4}>reducer function</CodeStep>. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.



`useReducer` is very similar to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component. Read more about [choosing between `useState` and `useReducer`.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#comparing-usestate-and-usereducer)

---

### Writing the reducer function {/*writing-the-reducer-function*/}

A reducer function is declared like this:

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}
```

Then you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a [`switch` statement.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) For each `case` in the `switch`, calculate and return some next state.

```js {4-7,10-13}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        name: state.name,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      return {
        name: action.nextName,
        age: state.age
      };
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}
```

Actions can have any shape. By convention, it's common to pass objects with a `type` property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.

```js {5,9-12}
function Form() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });

  function handleButtonClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });
  }

  function handleInputChange(e) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed_name',
      nextName: e.target.value
    });
  }
  // ...
```

The action type names are local to your component. [Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data.](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer#writing-reducers-well) The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it'll be an object or an array.

Read [extracting state logic into a reducer](/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) to learn more.

<Pitfall>

State is read-only. Don't modify any objects or arrays in state:

```js {4,5}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:
      state.age = state.age + 1;
      return state;
    }
```

Instead, always return new objects from your reducer:

```js {4-8}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ✅ Instead, return a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
```

Read [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) to learn more.

</Pitfall>



---

### Avoiding recreating the initial state {/*avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state*/}

React saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.

```js
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));
  // ...
```

Although the result of `createInitialState(username)` is only used for the initial render, you're still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it's creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.

To solve this, you may **pass it as an _initializer_ function** to `useReducer` as the third argument instead:

```js {6}
function createInitialState(username) {
  // ...
}

function TodoList({ username }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);
  // ...
```

Notice that you’re passing `createInitialState`, which is the *function itself*, and not `createInitialState()`, which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.

In the above example, `createInitialState` takes a `username` argument. If your initializer doesn't need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass `null` as the second argument to `useReducer`.



---

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### I've dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value {/*ive-dispatched-an-action-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-state-value*/}

Calling the `dispatch` function **does not change state in the running code**:

```js {4,5,8}
function handleClick() {
  console.log(state.age);  // 42

  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' }); // Request a re-render with 43
  console.log(state.age);  // Still 42!

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(state.age); // Also 42!
  }, 5000);
}
```

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `state` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:

```js
const action = { type: 'incremented_age' };
dispatch(action);

const nextState = reducer(state, action);
console.log(state);     // { age: 42 }
console.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }
```

---

### I've dispatched an action, but the screen doesn't update {/*ive-dispatched-an-action-but-the-screen-doesnt-update*/}

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

```js {4-5,9-10}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object
      state.age++;
      return state;
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object
      state.name = action.nextName;
      return state;
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

You mutated an existing `state` object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you're always [updating objects in state](/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [updating arrays in state](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) instead of mutating them:

```js {4-8,11-15}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    case 'changed_name': {
      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object
      return {
        ...state,
        name: action.nextName
      };
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

---

### A part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching {/*a-part-of-my-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching*/}

Make sure that every `case` branch **copies all of the existing fields** when returning the new state:

```js {5}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      return {
        ...state, // Don't forget this!
        age: state.age + 1
      };
    }
    // ...
```

Without `...state` above, the returned next state would only contain the `age` field and nothing else.

---

### My entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching {/*my-entire-reducer-state-becomes-undefined-after-dispatching*/}

If your state unexpectedly becomes `undefined`, you're likely forgetting to `return` state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn't match any of the `case` statements. To find why, throw an error outside the `switch`:

```js {10}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'incremented_age': {
      // ...
    }
    case 'edited_name': {
      // ...
    }
  }
  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
}
```

You can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.

---

### I'm getting an error: "Too many re-renders" {/*im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders*/}

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you're unconditionally dispatching an action *during render*, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

```js {1-2}
// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render
return <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function
return <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```

If you can't find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `dispatch` function call responsible for the error.

---

### My reducer or initializer function runs twice {/*my-reducer-or-initializer-function-runs-twice*/}

In [Strict Mode](/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn't break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn't affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:

```js {4-6}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added_todo': {
      // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state
      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });
      return state;
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Because React calls your reducer function twice, you'll see the todo was added twice, so you'll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state#adding-to-an-array):

```js {4-11}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added_todo': {
      // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }
        ]
      };
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Now that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn't make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don't need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

# Source: react.dev/src\content\reference\react\useContext.md

---
title: useContext
---

<Intro>

`useContext` is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to [context](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) from your component.

```js
const value = useContext(SomeContext)
```

</Intro>

<InlineToc />

---

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useContext(SomeContext)` {/*usecontext*/}

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```js
import { useContext } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `SomeContext`: The context that you've previously created with [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext). The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useContext` returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the `value` passed to the closest `SomeContext` above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the `defaultValue` you have passed to [`createContext`](/reference/react/createContext) for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useContext()` call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the *same* component. The corresponding `<Context>` **needs to be *above*** the component doing the `useContext()` call.
* React **automatically re-renders** all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different `value`. The previous and the next values are compared with the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. Skipping re-renders with [`memo`](/reference/react/memo) does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.
* If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if `SomeContext` that you use to provide context and `SomeContext` that you use to read it are ***exactly* the same object**, as determined by a `===` comparison.

---

## Usage {/*usage*/}


### Passing data deeply into the tree {/*passing-data-deeply-into-the-tree*/}

Call `useContext` at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to [context.](/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)

```js [[2, 4, "theme"], [1, 4, "ThemeContext"]]
import { useContext } from 'react';

function Button() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
```

`useContext` returns the <CodeStep step={2}>context value</CodeStep> for the <CodeStep step={1}>context</CodeStep> you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds **the closest context provider above** for that particular context.

To pass context to a `Button`, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:

```js [[1, 3, "ThemeContext"], [2, 3, "\\"dark\\""], [1, 5, "ThemeContext"]]
function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      <Form />
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}

function Form() {
  // ... renders buttons inside ...
}
```

It doesn't matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the `Button`. When a `Button` *anywhere* inside of `Form` calls `useContext(ThemeContext)`, it will receive `"dark"` as the value.

<Pitfall>

`useContext()` always looks for the closest provider *above* the component that calls it. It searches upwards and **does not** consider providers in the component from which you're calling `useContext()`.

</Pitfall>



---

### Updating data passed via context {/*updating-data-passed-via-context*/}

Often, you'll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with [state.](/reference/react/useState) Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the <CodeStep step={2}>context value</CodeStep> to the provider.

```js {2} [[1, 4, "ThemeContext"], [2, 4, "theme"], [1, 11, "ThemeContext"]]
function MyPage() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');
  return (
    <ThemeContext value={theme}>
      <Form />
      <Button onClick={() => {
        setTheme('light');
      }}>
        Switch to light theme
      </Button>
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}
```

Now any `Button` inside of the provider will receive the current `theme` value. If you call `setTheme` to update the `theme` value that you pass to the provider, all `Button` components will re-render with the new `'light'` value.



---

### Specifying a fallback default value {/*specifying-a-fallback-default-value*/}

If React can't find any providers of that particular <CodeStep step={1}>context</CodeStep> in the parent tree, the context value returned by `useContext()` will be equal to the <CodeStep step={3}>default value</CodeStep> that you specified when you [created that context](/reference/react/createContext):

```js [[1, 1, "ThemeContext"], [3, 1, "null"]]
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);
```

The default value **never changes**. If you want to update context, use it with state as [described above.](#updating-data-passed-via-context)

Often, instead of `null`, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:

```js [[1, 1, "ThemeContext"], [3, 1, "light"]]
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');
```

This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won't break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.

In the example below, the "Toggle theme" button is always light because it's **outside any theme context provider** and the default context theme value is `'light'`. Try editing the default theme to be `'dark'`.



---

### Overriding context for a part of the tree {/*overriding-context-for-a-part-of-the-tree*/}

You can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.

```js {3,5}
<ThemeContext value="dark">
  ...
  <ThemeContext value="light">
    <Footer />
  </ThemeContext>
  ...
</ThemeContext>
```

You can nest and override providers as many times as you need.



---

### Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions {/*optimizing-re-renders-when-passing-objects-and-functions*/}

You can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.

```js [[2, 10, "{ currentUser, login }"]]
function MyApp() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);

  function login(response) {
    storeCredentials(response.credentials);
    setCurrentUser(response.user);
  }

  return (
    <AuthContext value={{ currentUser, login }}>
      <Page />
    </AuthContext>
  );
}
```

Here, the <CodeStep step={2}>context value</CodeStep> is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever `MyApp` re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a *different* object pointing at a *different* function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call `useContext(AuthContext)`.

In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like `currentUser`, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the `login` function with [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) and wrap the object creation into [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo). This is a performance optimization:

```js {6,9,11,14,17}
import { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';

function MyApp() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);

  const login = useCallback((response) => {
    storeCredentials(response.credentials);
    setCurrentUser(response.user);
  }, []);

  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({
    currentUser,
    login
  }), [currentUser, login]);

  return (
    <AuthContext value={contextValue}>
      <Page />
    </AuthContext>
  );
}
```

As a result of this change, even if `MyApp` needs to re-render, the components calling `useContext(AuthContext)` won't need to re-render unless `currentUser` has changed.

Read more about [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo#skipping-re-rendering-of-components) and [`useCallback`.](/reference/react/useCallback#skipping-re-rendering-of-components)

## Troubleshooting {/*troubleshooting*/}

### My component doesn't see the value from my provider {/*my-component-doesnt-see-the-value-from-my-provider*/}

There are a few common ways that this can happen:

1. You're rendering `<SomeContext>` in the same component (or below) as where you're calling `useContext()`. Move `<SomeContext>` *above and outside* the component calling `useContext()`.
2. You may have forgotten to wrap your component with `<SomeContext>`, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using [React DevTools.](/learn/react-developer-tools)
3. You might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes `SomeContext` as seen from the providing component and `SomeContext` as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like `window.SomeContext1` and `window.SomeContext2` and then checking whether `window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2` in the console. If they're not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.

### I am always getting `undefined` from my context although the default value is different {/*i-am-always-getting-undefined-from-my-context-although-the-default-value-is-different*/}

You might have a provider without a `value` in the tree:

```js {1,2}
// 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop
<ThemeContext>
   <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

If you forget to specify `value`, it's like passing `value={undefined}`.

You may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:

```js {1,2}
// 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called "value"
<ThemeContext theme={theme}>
   <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

In both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop `value`:

```js {1,2}
// ✅ Passing the value prop
<ThemeContext value={theme}>
   <Button />
</ThemeContext>
```

Note that the [default value from your `createContext(defaultValue)` call](#specifying-a-fallback-default-value) is only used **if there is no matching provider above at all.** If there is a `<SomeContext value={undefined}>` component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling `useContext(SomeContext)` *will* receive `undefined` as the context value.

title: 'Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks'

<Intro>

React comes with several built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useEffect`. Sometimes, you'll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application's needs.

</Intro>

- How to reuse logic between components
- How to name and structure your custom Hooks
- When and why to extract custom Hooks

</YouWillLearn>

## Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components {/*custom-hooks-sharing-logic-between-components*/}

Imagine you're developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you'll need two things in your component:

1. A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
2. An Effect that subscribes to the global [`online`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event) and [`offline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event) events, and updates that state.

This will keep your component [synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with the network status. You might start with something like this:



Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this `StatusBar` updates in response to your actions.

Now imagine you *also* want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a Save button that will become disabled and show "Reconnecting..." instead of "Save" while the network is off.

To start, you can copy and paste the `isOnline` state and the Effect into `SaveButton`:



Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.

These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different *visual appearance,* you want to reuse the logic between them.

### Extracting your own custom Hook from a component {/*extracting-your-own-custom-hook-from-a-component*/}

Imagine for a moment that, similar to [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`](/reference/react/useEffect), there was a built-in `useOnlineStatus` Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('✅ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called `useOnlineStatus` and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:

```js {2-16}
function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```

At the end of the function, return `isOnline`. This lets your components read that value:



Verify that switching the network on and off updates both components.

Now your components don't have as much repetitive logic. **More importantly, the code inside them describes *what they want to do* (use the online status!) rather than *how to do it* (by subscribing to the browser events).**

When you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.

### Hook names always start with `use` {/*hook-names-always-start-with-use*/}

React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You'll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!

You must follow these naming conventions:

1. **React component names must start with a capital letter,** like `StatusBar` and `SaveButton`. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.
2. **Hook names must start with `use` followed by a capital letter,** like [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) (built-in) or `useOnlineStatus` (custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.

This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might "hide". For example, if you see a `getColor()` function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can't possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn't start with `use`. However, a function call like `useOnlineStatus()` will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!

<Note>

If your linter is [configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename `useOnlineStatus` to `getOnlineStatus`. Notice that the linter won't allow you to call `useState` or `useEffect` inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!

</Note>

<DeepDive>

#### Should all functions called during rendering start with the use prefix? {/*should-all-functions-called-during-rendering-start-with-the-use-prefix*/}

No. Functions that don't *call* Hooks don't need to *be* Hooks.

If your function doesn't call any Hooks, avoid the `use` prefix. Instead, write it as a regular function *without* the `use` prefix. For example, `useSorted` below doesn't call Hooks, so call it `getSorted` instead:

```js
// 🔴 Avoid: A Hook that doesn't use Hooks
function useSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}

// ✅ Good: A regular function that doesn't use Hooks
function getSorted(items) {
  return items.slice().sort();
}
```

This ensures that your code can call this regular function anywhere, including conditions:

```js
function List({ items, shouldSort }) {
  let displayedItems = items;
  if (shouldSort) {
    // ✅ It's ok to call getSorted() conditionally because it's not a Hook
    displayedItems = getSorted(items);
  }
  // ...
}
```

You should give `use` prefix to a function (and thus make it a Hook) if it uses at least one Hook inside of it:

```js
// ✅ Good: A Hook that uses other Hooks
function useAuth() {
  return useContext(Auth);
}
```

Technically, this isn't enforced by React. In principle, you could make a Hook that doesn't call other Hooks. This is often confusing and limiting so it's best to avoid that pattern. However, there may be rare cases where it is helpful. For example, maybe your function doesn't use any Hooks right now, but you plan to add some Hook calls to it in the future. Then it makes sense to name it with the `use` prefix:

```js {3-4}
// ✅ Good: A Hook that will likely use some other Hooks later
function useAuth() {
  // TODO: Replace with this line when authentication is implemented:
  // return useContext(Auth);
  return TEST_USER;
}
```

Then components won't be able to call it conditionally. This will become important when you actually add Hook calls inside. If you don't plan to use Hooks inside it (now or later), don't make it a Hook.

</DeepDive>

### Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself {/*custom-hooks-let-you-share-stateful-logic-not-state-itself*/}

In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it's wrong to think that a single `isOnline` state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

It works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:

```js {2-5,10-13}
function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).

To better illustrate this, we'll need a different example. Consider this `Form` component:



There's some repetitive logic for each form field:

1. There's a piece of state (`firstName` and `lastName`).
1. There's a change handler (`handleFirstNameChange` and `handleLastNameChange`).
1. There's a piece of JSX that specifies the `value` and `onChange` attributes for that input.

You can extract the repetitive logic into this `useFormInput` custom Hook:



Notice that it only declares *one* state variable called `value`.

However, the `Form` component calls `useFormInput` *two times:*

```js
function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');
  // ...
```

This is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!

**Custom Hooks let you share *stateful logic* but not *state itself.* Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook.** This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you'd like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.

When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, [lift it up and pass it down](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) instead.

## Passing reactive values between Hooks {/*passing-reactive-values-between-hooks*/}

The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks [need to be pure.](/learn/keeping-components-pure) Think of custom Hooks' code as part of your component's body!

Because custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:



When you change `serverUrl` or `roomId`, the Effect ["reacts" to your changes](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect's dependencies.

Now move the Effect's code into a custom Hook:

```js {2-13}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

This lets your `ChatRoom` component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:

```js {4-7}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:
        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

This looks much simpler! (But it does the same thing.)

Notice that the logic *still responds* to prop and state changes. Try editing the server URL or the selected room:



Notice how you're taking the return value of one Hook:

```js {2}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```

and passing it as an input to another Hook:

```js {6}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl
  });
  // ...
```

Every time your `ChatRoom` component re-renders, it passes the latest `roomId` and `serverUrl` to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It's as if the output of `useState` "feeds into" the input of the `useChatRoom`.)

### Passing event handlers to custom Hooks {/*passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks*/}

As you start using `useChatRoom` in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:

```js {9-11}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);
}
```

Let's say you want to move this logic back to your component:

```js {7-9}
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useChatRoom({
    roomId: roomId,
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    onReceiveMessage(msg) {
      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);
    }
  });
  // ...
```

To make this work, change your custom Hook to take `onReceiveMessage` as one of its named options:

```js {1,10,13}
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onReceiveMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

This will work, but there's one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.

Adding a dependency on `onReceiveMessage` is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. [Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#wrapping-an-event-handler-from-the-props)

```js {1,4,5,15,18}
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';
// ...

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);

  useEffect(() => {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    connection.on('message', (msg) => {
      onMessage(msg);
    });
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
}
```

Now the chat won't re-connect every time that the `ChatRoom` component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:



Notice how you no longer need to know *how* `useChatRoom` works in order to use it. You could add it to any other component, pass any other options, and it would work the same way. That's the power of custom Hooks.

## When to use custom Hooks {/*when-to-use-custom-hooks*/}

You don't need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a `useFormInput` Hook to wrap a single `useState` call like earlier is probably unnecessary.

However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer to also wrap it in a custom Hook. [You shouldn't need Effects very often,](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) so if you're writing one, it means that you need to "step outside React" to synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn't have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.

For example, consider a `ShippingForm` component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:

```js {3-16,20-35}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches cities for a country
  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
          setCities(json);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, [country]);

  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);
  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city
  useEffect(() => {
    if (city) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setAreas(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [city]);

  // ...
```

Although this code is quite repetitive, [it's correct to keep these Effects separate from each other.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things) They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn't merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the `ShippingForm` component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own `useData` Hook:

```js {2-18}
function useData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (url) {
      let ignore = false;
      fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
          if (!ignore) {
            setData(json);
          }
        });
      return () => {
        ignore = true;
      };
    }
  }, [url]);
  return data;
}
```

Now you can replace both Effects in the `ShippingForm` components with calls to `useData`:

```js {2,4}
function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);
  // ...
```

Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the `url` in and you get the `data` out. By "hiding" your Effect inside `useData`, you also prevent someone working on the `ShippingForm` component from adding [unnecessary dependencies](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) to it. With time, most of your app's Effects will be in custom Hooks.

<DeepDive>

#### Keep your custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases {/*keep-your-custom-hooks-focused-on-concrete-high-level-use-cases*/}

Start by choosing your custom Hook's name. If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component's logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.

Ideally, your custom Hook's name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn't write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:

* ✅ `useData(url)`
* ✅ `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)`
* ✅ `useChatRoom(options)`

When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system. It's good as long as it would be clear to a person familiar with that system:

* ✅ `useMediaQuery(query)`
* ✅ `useSocket(url)`
* ✅ `useIntersectionObserver(ref, options)`

**Keep custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases.** Avoid creating and using custom "lifecycle" Hooks that act as alternatives and convenience wrappers for the `useEffect` API itself:

* 🔴 `useMount(fn)`
* 🔴 `useEffectOnce(fn)`
* 🔴 `useUpdateEffect(fn)`

For example, this `useMount` Hook tries to ensure some code only runs "on mount":

```js {4-5,14-15}
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // 🔴 Avoid: using custom "lifecycle" Hooks
  useMount(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });
    connection.connect();

    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });
  });
  // ...
}

// 🔴 Avoid: creating custom "lifecycle" Hooks
function useMount(fn) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fn();
  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'
}
```

**Custom "lifecycle" Hooks like `useMount` don't fit well into the React paradigm.** For example, this code example has a mistake (it doesn't "react" to `roomId` or `serverUrl` changes), but the linter won't warn you about it because the linter only checks direct `useEffect` calls. It won't know about your Hook.

If you're writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:

```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Good: two raw Effects separated by purpose

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat', roomId });
  }, [roomId]);

  // ...
}
```

Then, you can (but don't have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:

```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  // ✅ Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose
  useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId });
  useImpressionLog('visit_chat', { roomId });
  // ...
}
```

**A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does.** For example, `useChatRoom(options)` can only connect to the chat room, while `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)` can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn't constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it's likely to introduce more problems than it solves.

</DeepDive>

### Custom Hooks help you migrate to better patterns {/*custom-hooks-help-you-migrate-to-better-patterns*/}

Effects are an ["escape hatch"](/learn/escape-hatches): you use them when you need to "step outside React" and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team's goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.

Let's return to this example:



In the above example, `useOnlineStatus` is implemented with a pair of [`useState`](/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`.](/reference/react/useEffect) However, this isn't the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn't consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, `isOnline` is already `true`, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser [`navigator.onLine`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine) API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.

React includes a dedicated API called [`useSyncExternalStore`](/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) which takes care of all of these problems for you. Here is your `useOnlineStatus` Hook, rewritten to take advantage of this new API:



Notice how **you didn't need to change any of the components** to make this migration:

```js {2,7}
function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```

This is another reason for why wrapping Effects in custom Hooks is often beneficial:

1. You make the data flow to and from your Effects very explicit.
2. You let your components focus on the intent rather than on the exact implementation of your Effects.
3. When React adds new features, you can remove those Effects without changing any of your components.

Similar to a [design system,](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) you might find it helpful to start extracting common idioms from your app's components into custom Hooks. This will keep your components' code focused on the intent, and let you avoid writing raw Effects very often. Many excellent custom Hooks are maintained by the React community.

<DeepDive>

#### Will React provide any built-in solution for data fetching? {/*will-react-provide-any-built-in-solution-for-data-fetching*/}

Today, with the [`use`](/reference/react/use#streaming-data-from-server-to-client) API, data can be read in render by passing a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to `use`:

```js {1,4,11}
import { use, Suspense } from "react";

function Message({ messagePromise }) {
  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);
  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;
}

export function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>
      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

We're still working out the details, but we expect that in the future, you'll write data fetching like this:

```js {1,4,6}
import { use } from 'react';

function ShippingForm({ country }) {
  const cities = use(fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`));
  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);
  const areas = city ? use(fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)) : null;
  // ...
```

If you use custom Hooks like `useData` above in your app, it will require fewer changes to migrate to the eventually recommended approach than if you write raw Effects in every component manually. However, the old approach will still work fine, so if you feel happy writing raw Effects, you can continue to do that.

</DeepDive>

### There is more than one way to do it {/*there-is-more-than-one-way-to-do-it*/}

Let's say you want to implement a fade-in animation *from scratch* using the browser [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) API. You might start with an Effect that sets up an animation loop. During each frame of the animation, you could change the opacity of the DOM node you [hold in a ref](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) until it reaches `1`. Your code might start like this:



To make the component more readable, you might extract the logic into a `useFadeIn` custom Hook:



You could keep the `useFadeIn` code as is, but you could also refactor it more. For example, you could extract the logic for setting up the animation loop out of `useFadeIn` into a custom `useAnimationLoop` Hook:



However, you didn't *have to* do that. As with regular functions, ultimately you decide where to draw the boundaries between different parts of your code. You could also take a very different approach. Instead of keeping the logic in the Effect, you could move most of the imperative logic inside a JavaScript [class:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)



Effects let you connect React to external systems. The more coordination between Effects is needed (for example, to chain multiple animations), the more it makes sense to extract that logic out of Effects and Hooks *completely* like in the sandbox above. Then, the code you extracted *becomes* the "external system". This lets your Effects stay simple because they only need to send messages to the system you've moved outside React.

The examples above assume that the fade-in logic needs to be written in JavaScript. However, this particular fade-in animation is both simpler and much more efficient to implement with a plain [CSS Animation:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)



Sometimes, you don't even need a Hook!

<Recap>

- Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.
- Custom Hooks must be named starting with `use` followed by a capital letter.
- Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.
- You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.
- All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.
- The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component's code.
- Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.
- Don't create custom Hooks like `useMount`. Keep their purpose specific.
- It's up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.

</Recap>

<Challenges>

#### Extract a `useCounter` Hook {/*extract-a-usecounter-hook*/}

This component uses a state variable and an Effect to display a number that increments every second. Extract this logic into a custom Hook called `useCounter`. Your goal is to make the `Counter` component implementation look exactly like this:

```js
export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter();
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

You'll need to write your custom Hook in `useCounter.js` and import it into the `App.js` file.



<Solution>

Your code should look like this:



Notice that `App.js` doesn't need to import `useState` or `useEffect` anymore.

</Solution>

#### Make the counter delay configurable {/*make-the-counter-delay-configurable*/}

In this example, there is a `delay` state variable controlled by a slider, but its value is not used. Pass the `delay` value to your custom `useCounter` Hook, and change the `useCounter` Hook to use the passed `delay` instead of hardcoding `1000` ms.



<Solution>

Pass the `delay` to your Hook with `useCounter(delay)`. Then, inside the Hook, use `delay` instead of the hardcoded `1000` value. You'll need to add `delay` to your Effect's dependencies. This ensures that a change in `delay` will reset the interval.



</Solution>

#### Extract `useInterval` out of `useCounter` {/*extract-useinterval-out-of-usecounter*/}

Currently, your `useCounter` Hook does two things. It sets up an interval, and it also increments a state variable on every interval tick. Split out the logic that sets up the interval into a separate Hook called `useInterval`. It should take two arguments: the `onTick` callback, and the `delay`. After this change, your `useCounter` implementation should look like this:

```js
export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

Write `useInterval` in the `useInterval.js` file and import it into the `useCounter.js` file.



<Solution>

The logic inside `useInterval` should set up and clear the interval. It doesn't need to do anything else.



Note that there is a bit of a problem with this solution, which you'll solve in the next challenge.

</Solution>

#### Fix a resetting interval {/*fix-a-resetting-interval*/}

In this example, there are *two* separate intervals.

The `App` component calls `useCounter`, which calls `useInterval` to update the counter every second. But the `App` component *also* calls `useInterval` to randomly update the page background color every two seconds.

For some reason, the callback that updates the page background never runs. Add some logs inside `useInterval`:

```js {2,5}
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('✅ Setting up an interval with delay ', delay)
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => {
      console.log('❌ Clearing an interval with delay ', delay)
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [onTick, delay]);
```

Do the logs match what you expect to happen? If some of your Effects seem to re-synchronize unnecessarily, can you guess which dependency is causing that to happen? Is there some way to [remove that dependency](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) from your Effect?

After you fix the issue, you should expect the page background to update every two seconds.

<Hint>

It looks like your `useInterval` Hook accepts an event listener as an argument. Can you think of some way to wrap that event listener so that it doesn't need to be a dependency of your Effect?

</Hint>



<Solution>

Inside `useInterval`, wrap the tick callback into an Effect Event, as you did [earlier on this page.](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks)

This will allow you to omit `onTick` from dependencies of your Effect. The Effect won't re-synchronize on every re-render of the component, so the page background color change interval won't get reset every second before it has a chance to fire.

With this change, both intervals work as expected and don't interfere with each other:



</Solution>

#### Implement a staggering movement {/*implement-a-staggering-movement*/}

In this example, the `usePointerPosition()` Hook tracks the current pointer position. Try moving your cursor or your finger over the preview area and see the red dot follow your movement. Its position is saved in the `pos1` variable.

In fact, there are five (!) different red dots being rendered. You don't see them because currently they all appear at the same position. This is what you need to fix. What you want to implement instead is a "staggered" movement: each dot should "follow" the previous dot's path. For example, if you quickly move your cursor, the first dot should follow it immediately, the second dot should follow the first dot with a small delay, the third dot should follow the second dot, and so on.

You need to implement the `useDelayedValue` custom Hook. Its current implementation returns the `value` provided to it. Instead, you want to return the value back from `delay` milliseconds ago. You might need some state and an Effect to do this.

After you implement `useDelayedValue`, you should see the dots move following one another.

<Hint>

You'll need to store the `delayedValue` as a state variable inside your custom Hook. When the `value` changes, you'll want to run an Effect. This Effect should update `delayedValue` after the `delay`. You might find it helpful to call `setTimeout`.

Does this Effect need cleanup? Why or why not?

</Hint>



<Solution>

Here is a working version. You keep the `delayedValue` as a state variable. When `value` updates, your Effect schedules a timeout to update the `delayedValue`. This is why the `delayedValue` always "lags behind" the actual `value`.



Note that this Effect *does not* need cleanup. If you called `clearTimeout` in the cleanup function, then each time the `value` changes, it would reset the already scheduled timeout. To keep the movement continuous, you want all the timeouts to fire.

</Solution>

<Intro>

TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases. Out of the box, TypeScript [supports JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) and you can get full React Web support by adding [`@types/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) and [`@types/react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) to your project.

</Intro>

* [Examples of typing with Hooks](/learn/typescript#example-hooks)
* [Common types from `@types/react`](/learn/typescript#useful-types)
* [Further learning locations](/learn/typescript#further-learning)

</YouWillLearn>

## Installation {/*installation*/}

All [production-grade React frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) offer support for using TypeScript. Follow the framework specific guide for installation:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.19.2/guides/typescript)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/typescript/)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)

### Adding TypeScript to an existing React project {/*adding-typescript-to-an-existing-react-project*/}

To install the latest version of React's type definitions:

<TerminalBlock>
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
</TerminalBlock>

The following compiler options need to be set in your `tsconfig.json`:

1. `dom` must be included in [`lib`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#lib) (Note: If no `lib` option is specified, `dom` is included by default).
2. [`jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#jsx) must be set to one of the valid options. `preserve` should suffice for most applications.
  If you're publishing a library, consult the [`jsx` documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#jsx) on what value to choose.

## TypeScript with React Components {/*typescript-with-react-components*/}

<Note>

Every file containing JSX must use the `.tsx` file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.

</Note>

Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component's props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.

Taking the [`MyButton` component](/learn#components) from the [Quick Start](/learn) guide, we can add a type describing the `title` for the button:



 <Note>

These sandboxes can handle TypeScript code, but they do not run the type-checker. This means you can amend the TypeScript sandboxes to learn, but you won't get any type errors or warnings. To get type-checking, you can use the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) or use a more fully-featured online sandbox.

</Note>

This inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an `interface` or `type` to describe the component's props:



The type describing your component's props can be as simple or as complex as you need, though they should be an object type described with either a `type` or `interface`. You can learn about how TypeScript describes objects in [Object Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html) but you may also be interested in using [Union Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types) to describe a prop that can be one of a few different types and the [Creating Types from Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/types-from-types.html) guide for more advanced use cases.


## Example Hooks {/*example-hooks*/}

The type definitions from `@types/react` include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get [inferred types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html) a lot of the time and ideally do not need to handle the minutiae of providing the types.

However, we can look at a few examples of how to provide types for Hooks.

### `useState` {/*typing-usestate*/}

The [`useState` Hook](/reference/react/useState) will re-use the value passed in as the initial state to determine what the type of the value should be. For example:

```ts
// Infer the type as "boolean"
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
```

This will assign the type of `boolean` to `enabled`, and `setEnabled` will be a function accepting either a `boolean` argument, or a function that returns a `boolean`. If you want to explicitly provide a type for the state, you can do so by providing a type argument to the `useState` call:

```ts
// Explicitly set the type to "boolean"
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

This isn't very useful in this case, but a common case where you may want to provide a type is when you have a union type. For example, `status` here can be one of a few different strings:

```ts
type Status = "idle" | "loading" | "success" | "error";

const [status, setStatus] = useState<Status>("idle");
```

Or, as recommended in [Principles for structuring state](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#principles-for-structuring-state), you can group related state as an object and describe the different possibilities via object types:

```ts
type RequestState =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success', data: any }
  | { status: 'error', error: Error };

const [requestState, setRequestState] = useState<RequestState>({ status: 'idle' });
```

### `useReducer` {/*typing-usereducer*/}

The [`useReducer` Hook](/reference/react/useReducer) is a more complex Hook that takes a reducer function and an initial state. The types for the reducer function are inferred from the initial state. You can optionally provide a type argument to the `useReducer` call to provide a type for the state, but it is often better to set the type on the initial state instead:




We are using TypeScript in a few key places:

 - `interface State` describes the shape of the reducer's state.
 - `type CounterAction` describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer.
 - `const initialState: State` provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by `useReducer` by default.
 - `stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State` sets the types for the reducer function's arguments and return value.

A more explicit alternative to setting the type on `initialState` is to provide a type argument to `useReducer`:

```ts
import { stateReducer, State } from './your-reducer-implementation';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

export default function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer<State>(stateReducer, initialState);
}
```

### `useContext` {/*typing-usecontext*/}

The [`useContext` Hook](/reference/react/useContext) is a technique for passing data down the component tree without having to pass props through components. It is used by creating a provider component and often by creating a Hook to consume the value in a child component.

The type of the value provided by the context is inferred from the value passed to the `createContext` call:



This technique works when you have a default value which makes sense - but there are occasionally cases when you do not, and in those cases `null` can feel reasonable as a default value. However, to allow the type-system to understand your code, you need to explicitly set `ContextShape | null` on the `createContext`.

This causes the issue that you need to eliminate the `| null` in the type for context consumers. Our recommendation is to have the Hook do a runtime check for it's existence and throw an error when not present:

```js {5, 16-20}
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useMemo } from 'react';

// This is a simpler example, but you can imagine a more complex object here
type ComplexObject = {
  kind: string
};

// The context is created with `| null` in the type, to accurately reflect the default value.
const Context = createContext<ComplexObject | null>(null);

// The `| null` will be removed via the check in the Hook.
const useGetComplexObject = () => {
  const object = useContext(Context);
  if (!object) { throw new Error("useGetComplexObject must be used within a Provider") }
  return object;
}

export default function MyApp() {
  const object = useMemo(() => ({ kind: "complex" }), []);

  return (
    <Context value={object}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Context>
  )
}

function MyComponent() {
  const object = useGetComplexObject();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current object: {object.kind}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### `useMemo` {/*typing-usememo*/}

<Note>

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual `useMemo` calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.

</Note>

The [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) Hooks will create/re-access a memorized value from a function call, re-running the function only when dependencies passed as the 2nd parameter are changed. The result of calling the Hook is inferred from the return value from the function in the first parameter. You can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.

```ts
// The type of visibleTodos is inferred from the return value of filterTodos
const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
```


### `useCallback` {/*typing-usecallback*/}

<Note>

[React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler) automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual `useCallback` calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.

</Note>

The [`useCallback`](/reference/react/useCallback) provide a stable reference to a function as long as the dependencies passed into the second parameter are the same. Like `useMemo`, the function's type is inferred from the return value of the function in the first parameter, and you can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook.


```ts
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // ...
}, [todos]);
```

When working in TypeScript strict mode `useCallback` requires adding types for the parameters in your callback. This is because the type of the callback is inferred from the return value of the function, and without parameters the type cannot be fully understood.

Depending on your code-style preferences, you could use the `*EventHandler` functions from the React types to provide the type for the event handler at the same time as defining the callback:

```ts
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Change me");

  const handleChange = useCallback<React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>>((event) => {
    setValue(event.currentTarget.value);
  }, [setValue])

  return (
    <>
      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Useful Types {/*useful-types*/}

There is quite an expansive set of types which come from the `@types/react` package, it is worth a read when you feel comfortable with how React and TypeScript interact. You can find them [in React's folder in DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts). We will cover a few of the more common types here.

### DOM Events {/*typing-dom-events*/}

When working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to explicitly set the type of the event.



There are many types of events provided in the React types - the full list can be found [here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/b580df54c0819ec9df62b0835a315dd48b8594a9/types/react/index.d.ts#L1247C1-L1373) which is based on the [most popular events from the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

When determining the type you are looking for you can first look at the hover information for the event handler you are using, which will show the type of the event.

If you need to use an event that is not included in this list, you can use the `React.SyntheticEvent` type, which is the base type for all events.

### Children {/*typing-children*/}

There are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the `React.ReactNode` type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX:

```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

This is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the `React.ReactElement` type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers:

```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactElement;
}
```

Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts `<li>` children.

You can see an example of both `React.ReactNode` and `React.ReactElement` with the type-checker in [this TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAJQKYEMDG8BmUIjgIilQ3wChSB6CxYmAOmXRgDkIATJOdNJMGAZzgwAFpxAR+8YADswAVwGkZMJFEzpOjDKw4AFHGEEBvUnDhphwADZsi0gFw0mDWjqQBuUgF9yaCNMlENzgAXjgACjADfkctFnYkfQhDAEpQgD44AB42YAA3dKMo5P46C2tbJGkvLIpcgt9-QLi3AEEwMFCItJDMrPTTbIQ3dKywdIB5aU4kKyQQKpha8drhhIGzLLWODbNs3b3s8YAxKBQAcwXpAThMaGWDvbH0gFloGbmrgQfBzYpd1YjQZbEYARkB6zMwO2SHSAAlZlYIBCdtCRkZpHIrFYahQYQD8UYYFA5EhcfjyGYqHAXnJAsIUHlOOUbHYhMIIHJzsI0Qk4P9SLUBuRqXEXEwAKKfRZcNA8PiCfxWACecAAUgBlAAacFm80W-CU11U6h4TgwUv11yShjgJjMLMqDnN9Dilq+nh8pD8AXgCHdMrCkWisVoAet0R6fXqhWKhjKllZVVxMcavpd4Zg7U6Qaj+2hmdG4zeRF10uu-Aeq0LBfLMEe-V+T2L7zLVu+FBWLdLeq+lc7DYFf39deFVOotMCACNOCh1dq219a+30uC8YWoZsRyuEdjkevR8uvoVMdjyTWt4WiSSydXD4NqZP4AymeZE072ZzuUeZQKheQgA).

### Style Props {/*typing-style-props*/}

When using inline styles in React, you can use `React.CSSProperties` to describe the object passed to the `style` prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the `style` prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor.

```ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  style: React.CSSProperties;
}
```
